<p>Beehives come in all price ranges and it depends on many factors, such as the 
size, material, design, functionality, and even history. We want to point out that 
if you have some woodworking skills and already have the raw materials, 
<a href="http://how2bee.com/how-to-start-a-beehive/">you can build your own beehive 
at a fraction of the cost of these beehives for sale</a>.</p>

<p>That said, if you're not 100% confident in your craftsmanship skills, it's highly 
recommended to purchase a pre-assembled beekeeping kit. We listed a few below, but 
there are numerous beekeeping kits that are offered on web shops like 
<a href="http://amzn.to/1TMG2DL">Amazon</a> or <a href="http://ebay.to/1Mktt1B">eBay</a>. 
At the same time, you shouldn't be too focused on saving money when you go out 
shopping for a beehive as it will likely be a purchase that will last you several 
years - and it could make you pounds of honey in the process!</p>

<p>That's why it's critical you make sure you get value for your money. Expensive 
beehives are typically priced highly for a reason. And we recommend discovering 
the reason behind the price before you make a purchasing decision. But enough said. 
This article ranks a few of the most expensive beehives money can buy. <em>Please 
note that expensive is relative to the value you'd be purchasing!</em></p>

<h3>Price: ~$600</h3> 

<p>The Hex hive is another expensive beehive in the market today. Typical hives 
can cost as low as $100 - but the hex hive isn't your typical hive. The hive is 
specifically designed to offer honeybees an environment that is as natural as 
possible. Hex hives are made with the secret to healthy colonies in mind.</p>

<p>For instance, all the hive's suppers are made from cedar, which is naturally 
smooth (on the outside) and rough (on the inside), giving your honey bees a natural 
environment to make a propolis envelope around the comb area. This creates a 
healthier antiseptic environment, which prevents diseases and parasites from 
penetrating the hive. The antiseptic environment also prevents bacterial growth.</p>

<p>The hexagonal shape of the hex hive also provides bees with the most natural 
environment to thrive. Hex hives resemble tree hollows. The hexagonal shape of 
each box also replicates the natural shape of bee cells giving them a natural and 
familiar space. The hive also features foundationless frames, which allow the bees
to build their own comb all the time. It gets better. The hex hive comes completely
assembled (with beeswax on every foundationless frame as well as beeswax starter 
strips). You just need to add your soon-to-be-happy bees!</p>
