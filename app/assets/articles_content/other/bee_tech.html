<p>There's the beehive. The traditional beekeeping supplies. And the beekeeper. 
Beekeeping really hasn't changed over the past hundred years, but it seems as though 
that might change. As technology is rapidly changing the planet and how we live in 
2015, it may completely change beekeeping in the next five years. Let's take a 
quick look at some of the companies and organizations that are positioned to 
revolutionize this age-old practice.</p>

<h2>Top 7 New Bee Technologies</h2>

<h3>MiteNot: Say Goodbye to Your Mite Problem</h3>

<p><strong>What's the MiteNot project?</strong> Mites are a serious problem for 
beekeepers – especially the Varroa mite. In fact, a colony infected with Varroa 
mites will usually die within 6 to 24 months.[1] But let's say your bee colony 
becomes infested with Varroa mites. What would you do? Many beekeeping communities 
have a trick to solve their Varroa mite problems.</p>

<p>Bee larvae are tolerant to (relatively) high temperatures, but Varroa mites are 
not. Varroa mites will die at 110°F while bee larvae can still survive at those 
temperatures. Keeping this in mind, savvy beekeepers will take out individual 
frames from the hive and put them in the oven at 110°F for about an hour to kill 
off the mites.</p>

<p><strong>So tell me about this new technology.</strong> MiteNot, a project 
developed by <a href="http://www.eltopia.com/mitenot/">eltopia</a>, is trying to 
automate this process so you'll never have to worry about mites again. But they 
face a hurdle: if a frame is heated within a beehive, the bees begin to freak out 
and will occasionally abandon the hive. However, bee colonies are used to a 
localized increase in temperature on frames when the queen bee lays eggs in 
individual cells. That means that if only localized sections of the frames are 
heated, the infected cells with mites can be sterilized without the hard work of 
removing all the frames to heat them in your oven individually.</p>

<p>Imagine you had hive frames that would automatically ensure your beehive is 
'mite-free.' This could be the solution to the systemic problem of mite infestations 
for beekeepers all around the world.</p>

<p><strong>Ok, but how would this affect beekeeping in general?</strong> Marla 
Spivak, a professor of Apiculture & Social Insects at the University of Minnesota, 
had this to say about Eltopia's 'MiteNot' project and its founders:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Will MacHugh, Richard de Leon and the rest of the crew at Eltopia 
are inspired and super creative. I talk to Will about the science of honey bees 
and parasitic mites and he rubs his forehead for awhile, digesting what I am saying, 
then suggests an experiment or approach that no one else in the world has considered. 
He then turns to Richard and asks him to invent some electronic apparatus to test 
the idea, and viola, here we are testing the MiteNot idea. To save the bees, 
beekeepers and bee researchers need a new, non-chemical way to control mite 
parasites in honey bee colonies. Eltopia's 'MiteNot' project is the most innovative 
and holds the most promise to turn the bee crisis around than any other idea that
has come along in a very long time — maybe ever.'</p></blockquote>

<h3>Bee Spotter: Let's Track Some Bees</h3>

<p><strong>What's Bee Spotter?</strong> Recognizing the decline in honey bee 
populations and the lack of a systematic nationwide effort to document the status 
of bees in North America, Bee Spotter has been set up by the University of 
Illinois as an initiative to effectively and on a large scale keep track of bee 
populations. The researchers at the University of Illinois are currently focusing 
on the states of Illinois, Ohio, and Missouri. But this project could expand 
quickly. Here's why.</p>

<p><strong>What's this new technology about?</strong> The goals at Bee Spotter 
are to engage citizens in the collection of data to establish a base for 
monitoring the decline in bee populations, to increase public awareness of 
pollinator diversity, and to enhance public appreciation of the importance of 
pollination for ecosystems. Bee Spotter uses photographs for identification of 
bee populations and its database reaches back to 2007.</p>

<p>If you are eager to contribute to their cause, Bee Spotter needs volunteers 
to take photographs of bees! You can go 
<a href="https://beespotter.org/beedata/enter">here to sign up and help out now</a>.</p>

<p><strong>So what's its potential impact on beekeeping?</strong> Bee Spotter 
could give much more accurate analytics on the status of current bee populations 
in the United States. This could bring serious benefits by providing experts with 
more accurate information as to why bee populations are currently declining.</p>

<h3>Beehacker: A Collection of Bee Technologies</h3>

<p><strong>What's this about?</strong> For the past hundred years, beekeeping 
hasn't changed much. But all of that is going to change with the help of 
<a href="http://beehacker.com">BeeHacker, a scientific blog on new and 
old-but-rarely-used beekeeping technologies</a>. If you don't want to do beekeeping 
the old fashioned way and would prefer knowing some creative solutions to 
beekeepers' biggest problems, you have to check this website out. It's purely 
informational, so expect to learn some fascinating beekeeping technologies.</p>

<p><strong>Tell me about these bee technologies!</strong> Beehacker provides 
information on the latest beekeeping technologies. These range from pocket-sized 
microscopes to identify different types of pollen, to high-frequency acoustics 
to listen to what your bees are saying in their hives, to bee robotics, to 
technologies that monitor a bee colony's brood.</p>

<p><strong>How could this affect the beekeeping community?</strong> Many of the 
beekeeping technologies mentioned on Beehacker have the ability to seriously help 
any beekeeper around the world. Trying out these new solutions to beekeeping's 
oldest problems could revolutionize the way you do beekeeping in the future.</p>

<h3>Robo-Bees: Stepping Up in a Period of Decline</h3>

<p><strong>What do they do?</strong> Many bee populations are dying due to 
<a href="http://how2bee.com/why-are-bees-dying">Colony Collapse Disorder</a>, which 
is caused either by pesticides, the changing environment, parasites, among a variety 
of other peculiar reasons. Although a recovery of natural bee populations would be
the best-case scenario, scientists at Harvard have developed technology in the 
shape of robotic 'bee' drones to help pollinate plants and flowers in the meantime. 
While this wouldn't help the bees at all (and, in fact, would replace them), the 
extreme decline in bee populations around the world may push humanity to develop 
its own robotic pollinators. This 'Robo-Bee' flaps its wings over an incredible 
100 times per second!</p>

<p><strong>Explain to me the technology?</strong> The Robo-Bee is still under 
development and its scientists are striving to come up with a small and effective 
battery since none exist at this point in time for Robo-Bee. Many people, 
particularly beekeepers, have moral objections to replace honey bees with robots. 
Nonetheless, the concept could potentially serve as a solution until bee 
populations are back to their normal levels. One question that remains is how 
effective these robotic pollinators will be compared to natural hardworking bees!</p>

<p><strong>And the impact on beekeeping?</strong> Ideally, there would be little 
to no impact on beekeeping and our fellow honey bees. But with today's decline in 
bee populations, it could assist industries that are dependent on pollinators for 
production.</p>

<h3>Flow Hive: Inspiring a New Generation of Beekeepers</h3>

<p><strong>Tell me a bit about this?</strong> If you're a beekeeper, you know how 
difficult and expensive it can be to harvest honey. Honey extractors, which separate 
the honey from your frames, often cost thousands of dollars. While for commercial 
beekeepers it may make sense to invest in such a machine, most hobbyists will find 
it a huge barrier to start beekeeping. Many people just turn to their 
<a href="http://how2bee.com/beekeepers-associations-laws/">local beekeepers association 
to borrow one of their honey extractors</a>, which the beekeepers associations are 
usually more than happy to share. But the time of expensive honey extractors may 
come to an end with the new Flow Hive.</p>

<p><strong>A quick video on the Flow Hive.</strong></p>

<div class="video-container">
  <iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O1M4-lE1Iic?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>The Flow Hive allows the honey in individual honey cells to flow freely through 
a tap and into a jar, making it so that the beekeeper doesn't have to go through 
the difficult and time-consuming process of traditional honey extraction. The hive 
is made with plastic, which is controversial as bees have a more difficult time 
adapting to plastic compared to wood. Nonetheless, the hive is attracting individuals 
who never thought of beekeeping to become beekeepers because of its convenient and 
sleek design.</p>

<p><strong>This could seriously affect beekeeping as we know it.</strong> The Flow 
Hive rarely needs to be opened. This means that the probability of being stung is 
also greatly reduced, which could be very useful in countries where the majority 
of honey produced comes from aggressive bees. Not only does this make it more 
convenient for beekeepers handling aggressive bees, but it also makes it more 
attractive for people that want natural honey without the risk of being stung.</p>

<p>While this may seem positive at first glance (more people will start beekeeping), 
there may be some negative effects for the bees. First, due to the limited amount of 
work needed by beekeepers to maintain the beehive, it may distance the beekeeper and 
his or her bees. The best chance to help the bees in an age where humanity is 
increasingly expanding and constructing on their habitats is to develop an intimate 
connection with people and bees. This beehive made over 12.3 million dollars in 
sales and continues to grow in popularity. Regardless, this new technology makes 
beekeeping widely available to people who otherwise would not start the hobby, and 
it makes honey harvesting vastly easier for those who are beekeepers.</p>

<h3>Phillips Urban Beehive: When, When, When?</h3>

<p><strong>Philips is getting into beekeeping?!</strong> The revolutionary design 
of the Urban Beehive is not like any hive you have seen before. It was revealed 
to the world in 2011 as a part of Philips' Microbial Home Design at Dutch Design 
Week. The hive was intended to allow regular people to have a glimpse into the 
fascinating world of bees and to harvest the honey that they produce. With the 
Urban Beehive, bees would be living inside your own house, and would allow
apartment-dwellers to harvest their own honey!</p>

[IMG] http://www.design.philips.com/philips/sites/philipsdesign/about/design/designportfolio/design_futures/urban_beehive.page

<p><strong>How does it work?</strong> The hive consists of two parts: an entry 
passage with a place for flowers for outside of the house, and a glass framework 
inside. The glass shell lets through the orange wavelength the bees need in order 
to see, and the network of honeycombs are on the inside. Harvesting honey has 
never been simpler, by pulling a smoke actuator chain you'll be able to easily 
take out some honey. Philips believes that the 'design contributes to the preservation 
of the species and encourages the return of the urban bee' highlighting that the 
Urban Beehive could offer cities benefits from pollination and urban city-dwellers 
benefits from the honey and the 'therapeutic value' of observing bees in action.</p>

<p><strong>I want one!</strong> You can't have it. Not yet. It's important to note 
that the concept is merely a prototype and, as stated on the Philips website, 'is 
not intended as a production prototype nor will it be sold as a Philips product.' 
Although much more comes to beekeeping than the current design can cater for, it 
could potentially be an effective way to lend a helping hand to the bees as their 
foraging habitats are becoming increasingly urbanized.</p>

<h3>Bee Smart Technologies: Revolutionizing the Beehive</h3>

<p><strong>What do they do?</strong> Beekeepers have a lot of things to keep 
track of inside their beehives – the humidity, the temperature, how much honey 
there is, how much brood there is, among many other things. But many of these 
measures could be taken automatically – and now they are with Bee Smart Beehives.</p>

[IMG]

<p><strong>And all of this is sent straight to your phone, continuously and 
immediately.</strong> Bee Smart Technologies develops high-tech beehives that 
monitor the temperature, humidity, and weight of your beehives to ensure you know 
your beehives' status right now. Why is this amazing?</p>

<p>Imagine you have several hives. But not only do you have several beehives, let's 
say you have several locations where you keep your hives. Bee Smart hives conveniently 
upload all data it constantly gathers to the cloud and allows you to keep an organized
maintenance, inspection, and honey gathering schedule. Check out this video if you're
not convinced!</p>

<div class="video-container">
  <iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bEQW_tvYPzY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>It's important to keep in mind that this business is still in its infancy. That 
said, its technology could be revolutionary to beekeepers around the world if it 
gets marketed successfully.</p>

<p><strong>How could this forever change beekeeping?</strong> The impact of Bee 
Smart Technologies would be enormous. As Bee Smart hives alert you immediately 
if there's a problem in one of your beehives, these hives could increase the 
survival rate of beehives throughout all seasons during the year. That means more 
honey for you, and a better quality-of-life for your bees. It will even allow 
commercial beekeepers to enjoy lower costs and greater honey (and bee bi-product) 
yields - and we're all in favor of bringing better honey to the table! We definitely 
recommend keeping an eye on this company in the coming years.</p>

<h2>Conclusion & Sources</h2>

<p>Beekeeping has stayed much the same over the past hundred years, but that may 
all change very soon. Many companies and organizations are developing unique bee 
technologies to help solve beekeepers' most difficult problems, which could be 
beneficial both for the beekeeping community and also the declining bee populations. 
How 2 Bee is always in favor of technology, especially when it means that there 
will be better times ahead for bees and beekeepers alike.</p>
