<p>Raising honey bees with a good temper is tricky but rewarding. Most honey bee 
colonies start out passive. Aggression creeps into their genetics due to a number 
of factors. For instance, seasonal changes are known to irritate honey bees. 
They also tend to be more aggressive in the spring and summer when they are 
producing and storing honey. This is often due to wasps and bees from other 
colonies invading hives during these two seasons. Honey bees in areas with bears, 
honey badgers, and other beehive predators tend to use aggression as a defense 
mechanism to protect their hive.</p>

<p>Specific bee species are prone to being more aggressive than others. For 
instance, cross-bred honey bee strains tend to be more aggressive than pure 
strains. Hybrids of the dark and Italian honey bee strains are considered to be 
aggressive. Similarly, daughter queens that were cross-bred with grey honey bees 
also tend to be aggressive. Therefore, honey bee aggression is caused by many 
factors.</p>

<p>It may seem as though the solution to bee aggression is to make sure your honey 
bees are a pure strain. But it's not. Although cross-breeding is among the main 
causes for honey bee aggression, it's important to understand that cross-strains 
are more resistant to harsh weather and diseases. Let's have a quick but 
detailed discussion on the main factors that make bees aggressive so you can keep 
raising honey bees that are happy and non-aggressive.</p>

<h2>Raising Honey Bees with Different Genetics</h2>

<p>Cross-bred honey bees tend to have bad temperament for many reasons. Climate
is one of them. Honey bee species, such as Maltese bees, are more aggressive to 
adapt and survive in tropical climates characterized by many hive predators and 
Varroa mite infestations. Although most beekeepers aren't bothered by aggressive 
bees, it's a huge concern to the public who might come across your bees in the 
neighborhood.</p>

<p>Beekeepers should be concerned about legal claims that may arise when their 
bad-tempered bees invade public territory and sting people. Research studies 
indicate that pure race bees are more docile. The problem arises when the colony 
raises its own queen, most likely due to re-queening. From one generation to the 
next, honey bees in such colonies tend to become exponentially more aggressive. 
Although this isn't always the case, it occurs frequently. Thus, the colony shouldn't 
raise its own queen if their genetics are already strong.</p>

<p>Aggressive bees don't have more painful or a greater amount of venom. Some 
people tend to make this association simply because aggressive bees are more 
willing to sting than docile ones. This willingness to sting is triggered by many 
factors. Bees are more sensitive to bee pheromone, or the chemical substance bees 
release from their sting glands to alarm the colony of impending danger. Aggressive 
honey bees will release more bee pheromone than temperate honey bees, which partly 
explains why they react more drastically.</p>

<p>According to research studies, aggressive honey bees respond approximately 2.4 
times faster to bee pheromone and move 30 times faster towards a moving target 
compared to non-aggressive bees. With regard to attacking style, aggressive bees 
usually attack in groups. During such attacks, they sting anything that is both 
in sight and moving. The attack can spread over a kilometer radius depending on 
the severity of the threat. High attacking rates are an evolutionary colony 
defense trait of cross-bred honey bee strains. Raising honey bees that are docile 
or non-aggressive directly depends on the specie you choose to keep.</p>

<h2>The Buzz of External Factors</h2>

<p>The weather and the climate are also related to bee aggression. Bees hate noise 
and shaking, which is why they are often angered by thunder storms. Studies also 
indicate that bees are angered by rapid drops in atmospheric pressure. However, 
perhaps more than any other factor, bees are most angered by poor beekeeper 
handling.</p>

<p>For instance, bees don't like a lot of smoke. You shouldn't smoke them countless 
times when inspecting the hive or harvesting honey. A few puffs are enough when 
taking supers or crown boards off. You should bear in mind that the smoke isn't 
supposed to incapacitate the bees but make them controllable. Smoke them sparingly
to get them out of the way so that you can avoid crushing them and getting 
stings.</p>

<p>Bees love to be handled gently with slow and deliberate movements. You should 
avoid aggressive methods of handling like slamming frames and hive bodies if you 
want to avoid stings and an angered colony. This is exactly why you need to wear 
protective beekeeping gear. When wearing a protective suit, there will be no need 
to smoke bees excessively or worry about stings. Therefore, dressing up properly
will allow you to feel relaxed when handling your bees and your colony will thank 
you for it.</p>

<p>You also need to go a step further by making sure you decontaminate your 
beekeeping gear properly. Previous stings on clothing and gloves leave the bee 
alarm pheromone, which can easily make calm honey bees aggressive when you revisit 
your beehive. You should make sure you clean your protective gear properly before 
revisiting your beehive and avoid cleaning your protective gear with perfumed 
detergents since bees respond aggressively to strong scents. You should instead 
use odorless detergents to clean everything. Also, you should avoid perfumes, 
cologne, or deodorant when you are planning to visit your hive.</p>

<h2>Replacing the Original Queen Bee</h2>

<p>Honey bees tend to become aggressive when the original queen is replaced. The 
colony can decide to replace the original queen if she is performing poorly. When 
the queen isn't laying enough eggs, the colony naturally gets agitated and replaces
her. When she's replaced by a queen from a different strain, which is usually the 
case, the resulting bees are ordinarily more aggressive. You can tell if your 
queen has been replaced by inspecting the hive regularly.</p>

<p>The original queen is easily spotted by conducting a thorough hive inspection. 
If she's missing (most probably because she has been killed), she is the reason 
behind your bees' bad temperament. Think about it, if your mom passed away you'd 
probably be pretty confused and emotional, too.</p>

<p>Even if she's replaced, the new queen usually results in offspring that have a 
bad temper since the new queen hasn't been carefully selected (she will most likely 
come from another hive with different genetics). You should replace the new queen 
immediately when raising honey bees to avoid getting an aggressive colony.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In a nutshell, this summarizes the main causes of honey bee aggression. You don't 
need to restrict your honey bees to having a pure strain for the sole purpose of 
avoiding aggression, as cross strain honey bees have many benefits revolving around 
weather and parasite resistance. It's about finding the right balance of good 
genetics and manageable temperament. You can take measures to control the aggressive 
behavior of cross strain honey bees by handling them with care, smoking them sparingly, 
and wearing proper gear when interacting with your hives.</p>

<p>Regular inspections can also avoid problems like a missing or replaced queen 
because you will be able to identify a queen who is performing poorly well before 
the colony makes plans to evict or kill her. A knowledgeable and experienced 
beekeeper can control the temper of all types of bees (even the most aggressive 
species) through good beekeeping practices. Raising honey bees to be docile is a 
strong strategy for almost all beekeepers.</p>
