<p>Once you get your hive, gear, and tools, it's time to finally get your colony 
going. There are two ways to do this. You can go out in the wild and try to 
gather a wild colony yourself, or you can simply purchase them to be delivered 
conveniently to your home. We'll go over the benefits and drawbacks of both so 
that you feel confident doing either!</p>

<h2>Getting Honey Bees for Sale</h2>

<p>Before getting some honey bees for sale, consider these four main factors before 
making a purchase.</p>

<h3>Over 29 Subspecies of Honey Bees</h3>

<p>Let's get something clear first and foremost. Not all bees produce honey. 
European bees, for example, are known to make a considerable amount of honey, 
whereas it's not guaranteed that the bees you gather in the wild are capable of 
producing honey. If you're wondering what's the best honey bee specie for your 
needs, it's always best to 
<a href="http://how2bee.com/beekeepers-associations-laws/" title="Beekeepers Associations">
ask local beekeeper associations</a> as they will know the precise honey bee 
specie that thrives in your region.</p>

<h3>Managing Your Bees' Temper</h3>

<p>If you're considering establishing your very first hive, you might want to 
<a href="http://how2bee.com/raising-honey-bees/" title="Raising Non-Aggressive Honey Bees">
invest in docile honey bees</a> for sale (non-aggressive) rather than gathering 
wild swarms. Many wild swarms can be too aggressive for a beginner beekeeper, so 
it's always a good idea for starters to buy honey bees for sale instead of sourcing 
them in nature.</p>

<h3>Be Prepared BEFORE You Get Honey Bees for Sale</h3>

<p>Make sure to order your package bees well-ahead of time to get your beehives 
prepared. You may also want to make sure that there's several plants in the 
vicinity of the hives that will last throughout the year and that have a yummy 
scent. This will affect the type of honey you get in the end. However, you don't 
have to plant flowers near the hives as your bees will be happy to travel great 
distances from their hive to get delicious nectar.</p>

<h3>Local is Better</h3>

<p>It goes without saying that honey bees for sale must come from a reliable 
supplier that can provide disease-free bees. If you are about to buy queen bees 
from overseas, keep in mind that they may bring with them new strains of viruses 
and diseases. It's definitely recommended to find a local supplier either through 
local beekeepers associations or even with a quick search on Google. If possible, 
choose queen bees that are from your country or, even better, your region as they 
will have stronger genetics against 
<a href="http://how2bee.com/bee-diseases-and-bee-predators/" title="Bee Diseases and Bee Predators">
local bee diseases and pests</a>.[1]</p>

<h2>Package Bees vs. Bee Nucs for Sale</h2>

<p>If you wish to get a colony going as a beginner beekeeper, it's best to purchase 
a nucleus colony (also known as a “nuc”). Package bees typically have a greater 
survival rate than nucs (due to a greater potential for bee disease or mite 
transmission).[2] Normally, the nucleus will contain a queen bee, brood, and 
workers.</p>

<p>Other beekeepers may wish to just get “package bees,” which consists of a 
recently-mated queen bee, workers, and food. Beginner beekeepers that can get some 
help from more experienced beekeepers may want to consider gathering a swarm. Please 
note that this is <em>highly discouraged</em> for beginners, as swarms can be more 
aggressive than package bees or bee nucs.</p>

<p>Both bee nucs and package bees have pros and cons when getting honey bees for 
sale. Bee nucs may contain old queen bees or weak genetics if they've been 
overwintered, which is a weakness that will then be transmitted to future 
generations. At the same time, you can typically view a nuc before you decide to 
buy it.</p>

<p>With package bees you'll have to purchase your queen bee separately. There are 
two ways to <a href="http://how2bee.com/how-to-raise-honey-bees">introduce the queen 
bee</a> to your colony, but only the indirect method will give the best odds of her 
survival.</p>

<h2>How Much Are Honey Bees for Sale?</h2>

<p>A survey of the major websites that offer honey bees for sale reveals that the 
average cost of a queen bee is around $20-30. Nucs often range from $120-200. 
Package bees vary from $90-120, though their price often changes depending on 
where you live.</p>

<h2><span id="Gathering_Wild_Swarms">Gathering Wild Swarms</span></h2><p>If you'd 
prefer to have a hive with wild bees instead of getting honey bees for sale online, 
here are some ways you can do it. Please keep in mind that only experienced 
beekeepers should do this!</p>

<p><strong>Contact your local council:</strong> They often receive calls from locals 
to remove wild bees from private property so let them know that you'd like to do 
it for them so you can give the bees a home.</p>

<p><strong>Contact a local pest control company:</strong> They, too, receive calls 
to remove swarms, so make sure to offer your free help in removing the bees.</p>

<p><strong>Gather them yourself:</strong> Gathering wild bees is done through 
collecting swarms. This can be rather daunting for beginners, so let's talk about 
a few methods you could use to gather them safely and easily. There are several 
methods to gather wild swarms yourself, such as luring them with a jar of open 
honey into your hive or placing a frame of empty brood comb inside their hive. 
However, netting them is often the most successful method to gathering a wild 
swarm.</p>

[IMG]

<h2>Steps to Get Wild Swarms</h2>

<p>Make sure you're wearing appropriate beekeeping gear before you set out to net 
your bees. A smoker or medicated syrup will prove helpful to subdue particularly 
aggressive swarms. The container can be a skep (the traditional domed basket) or 
even a cardboard file box.</p>

<h3>Tree branches:</h3>

<p>If you find a wild bee colony on a tree branch, gently cut the branch and 
place it into the container you have chosen. If the branch is too big, gently 
shake the bees and steer them towards the container with the use of syrup or 
honey.</p>

<h3>Fences or flat surfaces:</h3>

<p>If you find a wild bee colony on a fence or flat surface, delicately brush them 
with some cardboard and put them in your container of choice, luring them with 
syrup or honey if they prove to be a little stubborn.</p>

<p>Leave the container as close as possible to where you found the swarm. If the 
bees settle inside it, it means that the bee scouts and the queen are in there 
as well. If the queen bee has remained outside, however, don't be alarmed if the 
bees fly out of the box. You will have to repeat the process until the queen bee 
is inside the container. [7]</p>

<p>Even though one would always prefer to obtain free bees rather than purchasing 
them, you must keep in mind that 1) flying swarms often do not have the queen bee 
among them, 2) wild swarms may be genetically weak or may carry diseases, and 3) 
some laws might prevent you from gathering the bees if they're found on private 
property; make sure that you're aware of your local regulations before setting out 
to gather wild bees.</p>

<p><em>Now that you either purchased or gathered them, it's time to introduce your 
bees to their new home.</em></p>

<h2>Welcome New Bees, it's Time to Move In!</h2>

<p>Whether you purchased or gathered your bees, now you must get them inside their 
new home. When your packaged bees arrive, there's a few steps you should take to 
transfer them comfortably into your hive. If you gathered a wild swarm, different 
procedures should be taken.</p>

<h3>Hiving Package Bees</h3>

<p>Package bees can be bought from local beekeepers and bee breeders. The bees are 
usually put in hive-like packages, hence the name package bees. After buying them, 
the next big task is transferring them to their new hive (also referred to as 
"hiving"). It's important to bear some things in mind when transporting package 
bees and putting them in their new home. First and foremost, make sure you get 
your package bees in the off-season!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, you can't just wake up and go buy package bees if you're intent 
on getting the best bee strain. There's a season for shipping bees, which is usually 
short and characterized by a limited supply. To ensure you get your bees on time, 
place your order early (preferably during the winter) before the bee-shipping season 
starts in spring. You should also plan to get your package bees 6-10 weeks before 
the nectar flow starts in early April.</p>

<p>Before the honey bees for sale you purchased arrive, your beehive should be 
assembled and set up in <a href="http://how2bee.com/how-to-start-beekeeping">
the best location on your property</a>. In most cases, beekeepers and bee breeders 
deliver the packages to their customers so you shouldn't worry too much about the 
transportation. In case you aren't offered transport, again, don't worry too much 
about transporting the bees since package bees are parceled with safe transport 
in mind.</p>

<p><em><strong>Package Bees Arrived, Now What?</strong></em></p>

<p>When your package bee shipment arrives, examine it carefully. There's always 
a few dead bees in every bee package, so don't worry if you see some! Unless it's 
the queen bee. If she's dead, report it immediately. You should also report it if 
a significant amount of the swarm is dead. Most beekeepers and bee breeders are 
willing to replace the their honey bees for sale, so you shouldn't worry about 
losing your money. If your bees are alive and the weather is hot, find them a cool 
dark spot.</p>

<p>A chilled room is the most ideal for your bees when their waiting to move in 
their beehive. The room temperature shouldn't exceed 70°F. Consider smearing the 
screened sides of the package with sugar syrup to give your bees something to feed 
on while they wait to be placed in their new home. Sugar syrup also calms bees down, 
which makes them easier to handle when hiving them.</p>

<p><em><strong>The Time is Right, Let's Move Them In!</strong></em></p>

<p>You should feed your bees until they're quiet and full off of sugar syrup. You 
should then transfer the bees to their beehive late in the afternoon since this is 
the time when bees have the lowest tendency to drift. When transferring them, start 
by opening the hive and removing a few frames (usually 5 for a Langstroth hive) from 
each side of the hive to create space. Next, the design of the package bee box should 
fit snugly into the hive (again, only if it is a Langstroth hive). Please, do 
<strong>NOT</strong> shake them into the beehive!</p>

<p>There's a sensible reason for this. Although they may be small, they don't like 
being shaken up. Your bees will often correlate the traumatic experience of being 
shaken into their new hive with - well, being shaken into an unknown place. They 
will then perceive your beehive as being dangerous and often take off by morning 
to find a more tranquil home.</p>

<p>After you've placed your bee box inside the hive, take out the queen bee's cage 
that you'll find within the bee box and set it tightly in-between your frames with 
the vents not facing the frames. Make way for the queen bee to exit her cage. Her 
cage is usually sealed with candy. You can make a small hole so that the queen bee 
isn't able to get out immediately. You may even want to use a thin nail to make a 
hole through the candy. Do this carefully to avoid injuring or even killing your 
queen bee.</p>

<p>After making the hole, suspend the queen bee's cage (screen-side down) between 
2 frames. Next, just remove the feeder canister. Place the can on the empty space 
left after removing the frames. The can should be top-side up.</p>

<p>Now, just leave the package near the hive and you can even lean it on the hive 
for them to crawl up it. The bees will naturally find their way into their new 
home. Leave the hive alone for 7 days. However, you should ensure that there is 
enough sugar syrup to feed the bees for a week. Check out 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWbQUPAIlqs" title="Having Package Bees without Shaking Them">
this cool video that shows you how to hive package bees</a> without shaking them!</p>

<p>If the queen bee hasn't escaped from her cage after a week, let her out. Feed 
your bees continuously until the nectar flow begins and the bee colony is capable 
of sourcing its own food and storing honey (check out our article Bees in Winter, 
Spring, Summer, and Fall for more information on nectar flows).</p>

<h3>Hiving a Wild Swarm</h3>

<p>Instead of getting honey bees for sale from beekeepers and bee breeders, you 
can also get them from the wild. It's possible to move a wild swarm of bees from 
a tree or a building and into your own hive (also known as "hiving a swarm"). 
Collecting wild swarms is advisable only when you are confident yourself, sure 
that it's honey bees, and certain that it has good genetics.</p>

<p>So if you're really keen on hiving a swarm of bees, let's go over the basics 
on how to do it. For instance, you should know how to find wild swarms. One of 
the best ways of <a href="http://how2bee.com/honey-bees-for-sale/"><em>finding 
swarms is to contact agencies</em></a>, such as your local police and fire 
department since people call such agencies when they spot bee swarms for 
<a href="http://how2bee.com/bee-removal" title="3 Simple Bee Removal Methods">
bee removal</a>.</p>

[IMG]

<p>To ensure a successful gathering of a wild swarm, focus on having all your 
equipment ready so that you can capture any wild swarm swiftly and with only a 
moment's notice. To capture a swarm, you just need to be at the right place, at 
the right time, and with the right equipment. The bees will enter the beehive on 
their own if it is done correctly.</p>

<p>Swarms that are high up in trees are harder to capture. To reach such swarms, 
you need to use a ladder to get to the hive and lower it carefully to the ground 
next to your beehive. As long as your hive is ready, sprayed with sugar syrup, 
and you get the wild swarm's queen into your beehive, then the other bees will 
willingly move into their new home.</p>

<p><em><strong>A Quick Hint on Hiving Wild Swarms</strong></em></p>

<p>Consider using old dark combs to make the process of hiving bees easier and 
to make your bees more comfortable. Bees typically accept dark combs more easily 
than when you use new combs or foundations. It's also important to note that you
can speed up the transfer process by smoking the workers and queen bee into the 
new beehive and placing the queen excluder between the new and old hive bodies. 
Doing this forces the queen bee to lay eggs inside the new beehive, which gives 
the signal to the other bees that it's time to focus on their new home. Their old 
wild beehive should be cleared of the entire worker brood in less than 21 days.</p>
