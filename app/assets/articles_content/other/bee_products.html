<p>When you <a href="http://how2bee.com/steps" title="Steps to Start Beekeeping Today">
start beekeeping</a>, you set yourself up to get many products apart from honey. 
For instance, you can get beeswax, bee propolis, bee pollen, and royal jelly â€“ 
all of which are tested and proven to have a variety of health and commercial 
benefits. Here's a brief discussion of each of these bee bi-products, their 
benefits, how to extract them, among other important information.</p>

[TOC]

<h2>Beeswax</h2>

<p>Beeswax is obtained by sieving comb honey. According to scientific research 
studies, beeswax contains 284 compounds, including saturated and unsaturated 
monoesters, saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons, diesters, free acids, and 
hydroxyl polyesters. Beeswax is made by bees that are 2-3 weeks old before they 
leave the hive for the first time to forage. Worker bees that ate too much honey 
secrete small colorless wax platelets from 8 wax glands located below their 
abdomens.</p>

<p>The wax platelets are scraped off by other bees and chewed into elastic opaque 
pieces using saliva and enzyme action. The opaque pieces are then re-chewed 
before they are attached to form hexagonal honeycomb cells, which are the main 
building blocks for hives. Beeswax is used to construct comb cells for young bees. 
When beeswax is mixed with propolis, the wax is used for sealing cracks in the 
beehive as well as protecting the young brood from infections. Beeswax is also 
used to build honey cells and cap ripened cells. Beeswax is undoubtedly the most 
versatile bee by-product.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that beeswax was more precious than honey in ancient times 
considering it was used as tender in some parts of Europe. Beeswax was also used 
historically by artisans to make models. But it didn't stop there, as it was also 
used as lubricant, glue, polish, and preservative. Today, beeswax is used to make 
candles, cosmetics, polishes, pharmaceuticals, and even a variety of food.</p>

<h2>Bee Propolis Benefits</h2>

<p>Bees use propolis to seal cracks in their hives and to protect themselves 
against fungi and bacteria (link to common bee threats). So you might be wondering, 
what is propolis then? Bee propolis is a sticky substance made by bees when they 
collect resins from flowers, trees, and artificial sources. The composition of 
propolis depends on factors like season, location, type of hive, and availability 
of resin sources. Typical propolis is composed of approximately 50% resin and 
vegetable balsams, 30% waxes, 10% essential oils, and 5% pollen.</p>

<p>Propolis is harvested using a propolis trap placed below the top cover of the 
hive. The trap has small gaps that are approximately 6 mm wide or less. Bees are 
supposed to fill these gaps with propolis. Bees will typically fill small gaps in 
the hive using propolis but larger gaps using beeswax. Bee propolis benefits are 
numerous. For centuries, propolis has been used for its antimicrobial, detoxification, 
and antiseptic properties. Propolis is still being used to heal ulcers, burns, and 
inflammation today as it is also known as 'Russian penicillin.' It's even used as 
an antihistamine.</p>

<h2>Bee Pollen Benefits</h2>

<p>Pollen is another top honey by-product with numerous benefits. Pollen can be 
defined as a male gamete producing material. Pollen is composed mainly of amino 
acids, proteins, sugars, and lipids. Bees collect pollen when moving from one 
flowering plant to another. They bring back the pollen and store it in the comb 
where it is packed into granules. When it mixes with honey and nectar, which is 
also present in combs, the sugar and enzymes turn it into bee bread through a 
process known as lactic acid fermentation. Bee bread is the main source of protein 
for bees and they consume it to produce both royal jelly and beeswax.</p>

<p>There are an incredible amount of medicinal bee pollen benefits. Many studies 
indicate that bee pollen is capable of improving chronic problems and even curing 
health problems like male sterility, acne, common cold, ulcers, high blood pressure, 
and endocrine system disorders. However, these health benefits are yet to be 
scientifically accepted as being specifically from bee pollen. Clinical tests 
prove that pollen is capable of curing allergies and prostate problems ranging 
from infections and swelling to even cancer. Therapeutically, bee pollen is orally 
administered to treat hay fever symptoms due to its anti-inflammatory properties. 
But the benefits of bee pollen also make it a popular food supplement today. Bee
pollen can be harvested in brood cells where it is stored. You can identify it 
easily as it resembles small round balls.</p>

<h2>Royal Jelly Benefits</h2>

<p>Royal jelly can be described as a white fluid substance secreted by worker 
bees via glands located in their head. The jelly is used to feed bee larvae. Royal 
jelly is composed of 67% water, 12.5% crude protein, 11% simple sugars, 5% fatty 
acids, and the rest (4.5%) are enzymes, trace minerals, and vitamin C. But what 
is royal jelly and why do honey bees make it? The answer is in the name. The royal 
queen bee feeds on royal jelly exclusively from the time she is developing to the 
time she dies.</p>

<p>Royal jelly is acquired from queen cells when the cells are just four-days old. 
The jelly is harvested from the queen cells only because this is the only place 
where it's excessively deposited. Oddly, it's also sour with a pungent smell. Royal 
jelly benefits range from treating to lessening the symptoms of Alzheimer's and 
Parkinson's Disease.has antibacterial and antimicrobial properties. However, the 
royal jelly benefits don't stop there as academic sources also indicate that it 
is capable of lowering cholesterol levels.</p>
