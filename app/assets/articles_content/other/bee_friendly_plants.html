<p>Do you have a garden? Do you want to help the bees? And do you like sweet delicious 
honey? Bee populations are declining worldwide, but you can help! Although beekeeping 
is incredibly rewarding, you don't need to become a beekeeper to help the bees. 
Helping the bees all starts in your garden by growing bee friendly plants.</p>

<p><em>*Plants marked with (*) could be poisonous, which could potentially contaminate 
the honey in beehives.</em></p>

<h2>Gardening for Bees and Yourself</h2>

<p>Take a second and imagine how many suitable honey bee habitats would be created 
if most people made their gardens more bee-friendly - the quality of crops 
produced would increase drastically. You shouldn't just plant any flower, herb, 
or tree in your garden for the bees, though. Bees have special preferences when 
it comes to nectar and pollen sources. For instance, honey bees love wildflowers.[1] 
Honey bees also love variety, so it's important to plant many types of flowers and 
plants in your garden.</p>

<p>Variety is important because different plants and flowers thrive in different 
seasons. By planting a variety, this ensures that bees have a steady source of 
pollen and nectar throughout the year. You should also think about getting some 
flowering trees, such as birch trees, because they offer a variety of flower shapes 
and sizes. Flowering trees also offer honey with a very rich and delicious taste.</p>

<p>So don't just grow any type of plant in your garden if you're keen on attracting 
honey bees and giving them the best source of nectar and pollen. The type of plants 
you grow in your garden dictate factors like the quality and flavor of the honey 
that is produced. Honey bees are also bound to produce more honey when they forage 
single flowers since single flowers offer more pollen and nectar than double flowers. 
Single flowers also offer better access to the inner parts of a flower.[2]</p>

<p>Bees also love flowers that are bright in color, such as blue, yellow, and purple 
flowers. Brightly colored single flowers with shallow or flat blossoms, like zinnias, 
daisies and asters, are bound to attract more bees than any other kind of flowers.[3]
The perfect garden for bees should also have plants and flowers of the same species 
planted in clumps as opposed to the plants being scattered since this attracts more 
bees.</p>

<p>Simply put, a well thought out garden will act as a perfect habitat for bees to 
thrive (not to mention the aesthetic benefits your home will enjoy from having 
beautiful flowers!). It's also important to consider the shape of flowers you 
plant in your garden if you want to attract as many bee species as possible. It's 
important to note that there are <strong>over 4,000 species of bees in the U.S. 
alone</strong> and they all vary in sizes and tongue lengths, which means that 
they prefer different shaped flowers.[4]</p>

<p>If you're keen on discovering the best plants and flowers for bees to thrive, 
look no further. Below are the plants and flowers that honey bees thrive on by 
season. These plants include wildflowers, trees, shrubs and herbs, all of which 
make great bee plants. It's important to note that traditional varieties are always 
better as opposed to cultivated varieties since they contain better quality pollen, 
nectar, and also because they're free of harmful pesticides used to grow most 
cultivated varieties of plants and flowers.</p>

<h2>Seasonal Bee Friendly Plants</h2>

<p>Different plants thrive in different seasons. This is precisely why it's important 
to consider seasonal factors when cultivating your garden so that you can create a 
perfect habitat for bees to thrive in throughout the year. Luckily, bees love a 
variety of plants and flowers that grow in different seasons.[5] You shouldn't 
worry about not being able to plant the best plants for attracting bees during 
spring, summer, fall, and winter. Below is a detailed discussion of the plants 
bees love and when to plant them.</p>

<h3>Spring Bee Flowers</h3>

<p>All pollinating insects, including bees, start 
<a href="http://how2bee.com/how-to-raise-honey-bees/">raising honey bees</a>
during spring and continue to do so into the summer. Solitary bees need plenty of 
undisturbed nesting sites as pollen and nectar is gathered and stored to feed 
newly developing larvae. Typical honey bee colonies contain approximately 55,000 
worker bees and larvae to feed during spring.</p>

[IMG]

<p>Planting plenty of bee friendly plants during spring (that have nutritious nectar 
and lots of it!) is crucial to the survival of many bee colonies. Luckily, there 
are plenty of plants that thrive during spring that bees love.</p>

<p>A few of the best plants for spring include: [6]</p><

<ol>
  <li>Forget-me-not (Myosotis)</li>
  <li>Bistort</li>
  <li>Foxglove (Digitalis)</li>
  <li>Crocus*</li>
  <li>Poppy (Papaver)*</li>
  <li>Bugle</li>
  <li>Honey Suckle (Lonicera)*</li>
  <li>Crane's-bill (Geranium)</li>
  <li>Lesser Celandine*</li>
  <li>Muscari*</li>
  <li>Thyme</li>
  <li>Passion Flower (Passiflora)*</li>
  <li>Campanula*</li>
  <li>Sweetpea (Lathyrus)</li>
  <li>Rosa rugosa</li>
  <li>Penstemon</li>
  <li>Hebe</li>
  <li>Agapanthus</li>
  <li>Columbine (Aquilegia)</li>
  <li>Allium</li>
  <li>Sea Holly (Eryngium)</li>
  <li>Lupin (Lupinus)</li>
</ol>

<p>All these plants are nutritious for bees. <strong>They also result in honey with 
amazing flavor if you're a beekeeper!</strong> Furthermore, the above plants are 
also aesthetically appealing, which means your garden will look amazing during 
spring. However, we do recommend to stick to the wild varieties of all the above 
plants since they're more nutritious and safe for bees.[7]</p>

<h3>Summer Bee Plants</h3>

<p>Bees continue feeding late developing broods during summer and early autumn. 
During this period, there are also bees that have developed into adult worker bees. 
Colonies are usually stable during summer if they could forage properly during 
spring. There's many plants you can grow in your garden during summer to attract 
bees and provide a perfect source of pollen and nectar. These plants range from 
scabiosa* to sunflowers to cornflowers. Goldenrod is another great plant for bees 
during the summer.</p>

<p>Other examples of summer plants that bees love include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Veronica*</li>
  <li>Sedum</li>
  <li>Purple Loosestrife</li>
  <li>Scorpion Weed</li>
  <li>Red Hot Poker</li>
  <li>Verbascum*</li>
  <li>Bergenia</li>
  <li>Watermint</li>
  <li>Hollyhock</li>
  <li>Bergamot</li>
  <li>Hellebores*</li>
  <li>Verbena*</li>
  <li>Raspberries</li>
  <li>Himalayan Balsam</li>
  <li>Bugle (Ajuga)</li>
  <li>Snapdragon (Antirrhinum)*</li>
  <li>Nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus)</li>
</ol>

[IMG]

<p>The above plants thrive during summer and provide foraging bees with plenty of 
nutritious nectar and pollen, which is perfect for them to make delicious honey. 
Also, most of the plants mentioned above attract other pollinators as well (apart 
from bees) making them perfect for summer pollination. Sunflowers and cornflowers 
will look great in your garden with their bright yellow and purple color, 
respectively.[8]</p>

<h3>Autumn Bee Flowers</h3>

<p>Many plants don't thrive in autumn. As a result, bees are forced to forage longer 
distances to get enough food. There are, however, a number of plants you can grow 
in your garden to provide foraging bees with adequate pollen and nectar without 
having to travel long distances. Trees are your best bet during autumn, although 
there are a few other plants that you can plant as well. The Papital is loved by 
bees and birds. It's also known as the Ivy hedera helix as it's among the few
plants responsible for the survival of late foragers.</p>

<p>This plant is perfect for your garden during autumn because it paves way for the 
development of berries, which are loved by bees and birds. The Papital also offers 
bees excellent shelter when the plant perches on healthy garden trees. Other plants 
that are perfect for bees during autumn include Viburnum, autumn raspberries, Mint,
Common Heather and Oregano.[9]</p>

<h3>Winter Bee Plants</h3>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, there are a lot of plants you can plant during winter 
that bees will love. This of course applies to the late winter to early spring 
period when flowering resumes on a small scale in most places in the U.S. Honey 
bees love crocus flowers during this period but can't travel for long distances 
because of the cold weather. Planting crocus flowers in your garden is therefore 
one of the best ways of ensuring that bees get adequate amounts of nectar and 
pollen without having to travel long distances in the cold. Crocus flowers are 
also perfect for bumble bees, which don't mind foraging in winter.</p>

[IMG]

<p>Here's some bee plants for the winter you should consider: [10]</p>

<ol>
  <li>Winter Aconite</li>
  <li>Mahonia</li>
  <li>Genista*</li>
  <li>Daffodil*</li>
  <li>Gorse (Ulex)</li>
  <li>Dicentra</li>
  <li>Pulmonaria (Lungwort)</li>
  <li>Bluebell</li>
  <li>Cowslip</li>
  <li>Flowering Currant</li>
  <li>Primrose</li>
  <li>Snakeshead (Fritillaria meleagris)</li>
  <li>Barberry</li>
  <li>Winter Honeysuckle*</li>
  <li>Ground Ivy*</li>
  <li>Bugle</li>
  <li>Lenten Rose</li>
  <li>Winter Heathers</li>
  <li>Snowdrops</li>
</ol>

<h2>Bee Friendly Herbs</h2>

<p>There are many herbs out there that bees love. These herbs are also great for 
your garden because they add color and scent. If you're a beekeeper and gardener, 
these herbs can help you produce <strong>delicious honey</strong>. Furthermore, 
you can use the herbs for cooking, medicinal purposes, and much more. Herbs are 
also great for home gardens because they don't require a lot of space to grow.</p>

<p>You can even grow herbs in a container filled with soil and still attract 
plenty of bees to your garden. Herbs are also known to deter common bee problems 
like wax moth infestations. One such herb is mint oil, which deters wax moths 
when diluted and applied on beehives.[11] So plant some mint around hives to keep 
some bee predators away. Herbs are also excellent sources of food for bees, 
especially rosemary.</p>

<p>Some of best herbs for bees include: [12]</p> 

<ol>
  <li>Borage</li>
  <li>Chives</li>
  <li>Catmint (Nepata)</li>
  <li>Comfrey*</li>
  <li>Hyssop</li>
  <li>Lavender</li>
  <li>Sage</li>
  <li>Thyme Marjoram (Origanum)</li>
  <li>Mint (Mentha)</li>
  <li>Lemon Balm</li>
  <li>Fennel</li>
  <li>Angelica</li>
  <li>Wild Bergamot</li>
  <li>Corn woundworts*</li>
  <li>Betony*</li>
  <li>Myrtle</li>
  <li>Rosemary</li>
</ol>

<h2>Ok, but why are bees dying right now?</h2>

<p>The U.S. made plans to make millions of acres of land more bee friendly. The 
Obama Administration even created a $3 million subsidy fund in 2014 to encourage 
beekeeping in the U.S.[13] Only time will tell if these measures are adequate 
enough to counteract the declining bee populations that has rocked the U.S. and 
Europe for the past decade. The measures being taken currently by the U.S. government 
are not adequate. For instance, unlike the European Union, the U.S. government hasn't 
banned neonicotinoids, which are harmful to bees, despite being pressured by 
countless beekeeping groups as well as environmental and consumer groups.[14]</p>

<p>You shouldn't wait for the U.S. government to reverse this worrying trend. There 
are a lot of measures you can take as a concerned U.S. citizen to increase bee 
populations. More than 100 types of crops grown in America depend solely on bees 
for pollination.[15] Considering bees also pollinate most plants consumed by 
livestock as well as fiber-producing plants like cotton, the importance of bees 
cannot be overlooked and everyone should do what they can to help bees pollinate. 
Especially since the U.S. lost more than 50% of all managed honey bee colonies in 
the past decade.[16]</p>

<p>Honey bees are also being affected by a decline in plant diversity due to two 
main factors: habitat loss and commercial agriculture. Both of these factors are 
affecting the ability of honey bees to extract enough quantities of essential 
nutrients from the current plant cover.</p>

<p>But you can help increase pollen and nectar sources in the U.S. by either 
becoming a beekeeper or start making a bee-friendly garden, or even both!</p>

<h2>Quick Helpful Gardening Tips</h2>

<p>Now that you already know (what to plant in your garden and when to plant) when 
you want to attract bees, check out these planting tips below for you to get the 
best outcome.</p>

[IMG]

<p>First and foremost, it's important to appreciate the fact that plant bulbs are 
very versatile. For instance, some bulbs may be great for lawns (say, crocus). 
Snowdrops and winter aconite bulbs are perfect for shady spots beneath trees while 
other bulbs, such as the crocosmia may be ideal for dry spots in your garden. 
Knowing such information can make a huge difference in your efforts to attract 
bees to your garden. So equip yourself with these tips and make sure to choose 
native varieties of plants when you buy plant bulbs to make sure they're tasty to 
your local bees.</p>

<p>Here's another important consideration. Most of the plants we recommended above 
will not be native plants for where you live. Not only that, but a few of these 
plants are even considered 'invasive species' and could be illegal to plant in your
State.</p>

<h2>Conclusion & Sources</h2>

<p>The above information summaries the declining bee population problem in the U.S. 
and gives you vital information on how you can become part of the solution. 
Operating a home garden is one of the easiest and best ways of attracting bees 
and giving them a good source of nutritious nectar and pollen.</p>

<p>You should consider cultivating plants and flowers that bees love for you to 
successfully attract bees. You also need to plant a variety of plants and flowers 
in your garden to ensure bees have a consistent supply of food given the fact that
different bee-friendly plants thrive in different seasons. After reading the above
information, you shouldn't have a problem choosing the best plants for bees depending 
on the season.</p>

<p>Now think about all those wonderful-smelling flowers you're about to plant in 
your garden - and now think about having that same scent in some fresh and delicious 
honey. But raising honey bees is much more rewarding than just the honey you'll get. 
Discover just how <strong>easy it is to start beekeeping today.</strong></p>
