<p>Honey is often the main reason why people start beekeeping. The luxury of 
having your own sweet delicious honey is very appealing. But honey harvesting can 
be difficult. There are two main ways to harvest your honey: with an extractor 
and without one. Let's talk about the pros and cons of both to make sure 
you do honey harvesting the easiest way!</p>

<h2>The Simple Crush and Strain Method</h2>

<p>This is one of the most simple ways to do honey harvesting. You don't need an 
extractor or a lot of time when honey harvesting using this method. Thirty minutes 
is more than enough time. However, the downside is that you can't harvest a lot 
of honey at once with this method. In fact, you can only harvest one comb at a 
time. Harvesting combs at different times has a number of benefits, the most 
notable being the rich honey flavor.</p>

<p>Since combs are harvested at different times, you have the opportunity to 
sample honey from many flower sources. One of the coolest parts about honey 
harvesting is that your honey will take on different flavors depending on the 
flora your bees visited. Single comb harvesting offers bees a number of unique 
benefits.</p>

<p>For instance, you don't disturb and anger bees like you would if you were 
harvesting an entire hive at once. This method is favorable for beginner 
beekeepers. Let's go in-depth about how to do honey harvesting with the crush 
and strain method.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Decap the Honey Cells</h3>

<p>Take a heated uncapping knife and decap the honey cells. You can use a hot 
knife dipped in boiling water. However, you must ensure the knife is dry before 
you start decapping the cells to avoid diluting the honey.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Cut the Comb</h3>

<p>After decapping the honey cells, cut off the comb into a bowl.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Mash the Comb</h3>

<p>Mash the comb until all comb cells break up and form a nice and even 
consistency.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Pour the Mixture into a Jar</h3>

<p>Pour all that mashed-up comb and honey into a jar.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Drape and Tie Mesh on the Mouth of Another Jar</h3>

<h3>Step 6: Mist the Screen Mesh</h3>

<p>After securing the fine screen in place, use a brass jar ring or tape and mist 
the screen mesh with some water to break surface tension that will automatically
develop when honey is flowing through.</p>

<h3>Step 7: Settle the Honey Jar on the Empty Jar</h3>

<p>Make a good seal and flip the jar with honey on top of the empty jar to form "hourglass 
jars." Put the two jars in a warm place and wait for approximately one hour. Honey 
will flow through the fine screen into the empty jar leaving behind the beeswax.</p>

<h3>Summary of Crush and Strain Method</h3>

<p>This method of honey harvesting is perfect for beginners that are doing honey 
harvesting from hives like top bar hives. You can also use a large container and 
a sieve to make the process simpler. For instance, place your mashed comb in a 
large sieve placed on top of a large bucket and leave it for an hour. You will 
still get the same results despite the fine screen mesh removing beeswax and other 
honey impurities.[1]</p>

<p>The easy crush and strain method is so simple that you don't need to use a 
smoker, a hive tool, among other equipment. However, it's advisable to be one-hundred 
percent prepared with everything beforehand to make your work easier.</p>

<h2>Full Harvest (Honey Harvesting the Entire Hive)</h2>

<p>This method of honey harvesting is more complex. It involves harvesting honey 
on all the combs at once using a honey extractor. Just by nature the process is 
a bit tricky, so you'll need to prepare yourself with all the beekeeping supplies 
and equipment you can get your hands on. Let's go over the steps on how to do honey 
harvesting with the full harvest method.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Light Your Bee Smoker</h3>

<p>Start by filling your bee smoker with bee smoker fuel. You should use 
<a href="http://how2bee.com/top-10-beekeeping-supplies/">bee smoker fuel specifically 
made for bee smokers</a>. This fuel lights easily and produces thick smoke, which 
calms your bees very effectively.</p>

<p>Smoking is necessary to do a full harvest because the bees will be quite 
aggressive. Imagine your good friend walks into your home and takes all your food 
from your fridge â€“ chances are you may be a bit angry, too. Smoke dulls bees' 
senses, which prevents them from picking up the alarm pheromone that warns the 
entire colony of danger. You may want to avoid overusing the bee smoker as you 
may spoil the flavor of the honey.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Prepare Supers and Wear Protective Gear</h3>

<p>The frames with the honey combs are transported in supers. You should proceed 
by preparing your supers when your smoker is ready. You should also have a cloth
for covering the supers with frames to prevent bees and other insects (like flies)
from reaching them. After doing this, you should put on your 
<a href="http://how2bee.com/top-10-beekeeping-supplies">bee suit, gloves, and footwear.</a></p>

<h3>Step 3: Open the Beehive</h3>

<p>Use your hive tool to open the hive. While doing this, move your bee smoker around
to calm the bees. Blow smoke into the hive while opening the hive lid slowly. The 
bees should be calm if you do it properly.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Inspect Frames for Honey</h3>

<p>Begin by pulling out the frames and inspecting the honey combs. The quantity of 
honey you harvest will depend on factors like weather, the size of your colony, 
the size of your hive, among other dynamics. Inspect the frames to identify sealed 
frames. Uncapped cells (with some nectar) shouldn't be harvested.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Inspect All Supers</h3>

<p>You may be forced to inspect multiple supers depending on your hive's configuration.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Scrape Extra Cells</h3>

<p>In case there are extra cells between frames and supers, scrape them off using 
a hive tool.</p>

<h3>Step 7: Begin Harvesting</h3>

<p>Honey harvesting starts at this stage. Start by pulling out the frames filled 
with honey (at least 80%) and put them inside the harvest super. A typical hive 
is capable of holding approximately 6.5 pounds of honey, so expect to do a mild 
workout.</p>

<h3>Step 8: Distinguish Honey, Nectar, Brood, and Pollen</h3>

<p>Typical hives have frames featuring many different honey comb colors. Light-colored 
combs contain pure honey. Darker ones contain pollen. Frames with the capped brood 
(baby bees) are usually tan in color. The capped brood is usually located in the 
middle and center of the hive. You should be on the lookout for crescent shaped 
combs as this is an indication of where a brood was located. Crescent shaped combs 
should be filled with honey and pollen. Nectar resembles shining solids when you 
uncap the honey cells.</p>

<h3>Step 9: Extract the Honey</h3>

<p>Extraction starts by removing bees from honey supers. This is important to avoid 
carrying bees to your home or the location of the extractor. You can remove bees 
from honey supers using a number of methods. The most popular method involves 
shaking the bees off at the hive entrance or on top of the hive. This method is 
accompanied by the use of a special brush known as the "bee brush." The bee brush 
is specially made to get bees off supers without injuring or killing them. However, 
it's very important to exercise some caution when using the bee brush by gently 
brushing them in an upward motion, which will avoid injuring or killing those 
located on the cells you're brushing.</p>

<p>You can also blow the bees out. You need a bee blower for this method. A leaf 
blower can serve the same purpose but you need to be very careful not to harm the 
bees. This method is fast but <strong>NOT</strong> recommended because wind is 
known to disorient and irritate bees very much.</p>

<p>You can also use a bee escape board. Place the board between the honey supers 
you want to clear and the upper deep hive body. The bees will swiftly travel from 
the honey supers into the brood nests but won't return back to the supers as fast 
because it takes time for them to find their way back.</p>

<p>Fume boards are also effective to remove bees from honey supers. Fume boards 
resemble outer covers with flannel lining. The flannel linings of the boards are 
smeared with liquid bee repellent and placed on the honey supers. Within 3 to 5 
minutes, the bees will have abandoned the honey supers. You can now proceed and 
remove your super and cover it.</p>

<p>Although this method is very fast and effective, it's <em>highly discouraged</em> 
because bee repellents are packed with chemicals like benzaldehyde, anhydride, 
butyric and propionic, which are either toxic or combustible. These chemicals have 
also been associated with health problems such as dermatitis, liver damage, 
respiratory damage, and CNS (central nervous system) depression. Therefore, it's 
better to stick to methods like shaking because they are effective and don't pose 
any health risks to neither you nor your bees.</p>

<p>After getting the bees off the supers, you can take the frame with capped honey 
and mount it above the tub to extract wax and honey. Start by uncapping the honey 
cells using a heated uncapping knife. Lean the knife on the frame edges in a 30 
degree angle and move fast from top-to-bottom or bottom-to-top (it depends on your 
preferences).</p>

<p>You'll want to move fast to avoid burning the honey and spoiling its flavor. 
Repeat the process on the other side of the frame. The heated knife will uncap 
off the honey cells. Use an uncapping fork to uncap those cells that are still 
capped after the process.</p>

<h3>Step 10: Place the Frames Inside the Extractor</h3>

<p>After uncapping, preheat the honey extractor and place the uncapped frames 
inside the honey extractor. When all frames are secured, close the honey extractor 
lid and let the extractor get to work. The honey extractor functions by using 
centrifugal force (spinning force coupled with some heat). It should start spinning 
slowly and gradually speed up. Within 10-15 minutes, the extraction process should 
be over. Honey should be stuck on the sides and bottom of the extractor.[2]</p>

<h3>Step 11: Drain the Honey</h3>

<p>Use your food grade bucket to collect the honey. The bucket should be placed 
directly under the honey extractor spigot so that the honey drains smoothly without 
spilling. Remember to use your double sieve here to trap any wax and impurities 
that may be present in the honey at this point. Don't leave the extractor unattended 
until all the honey from the extractor has been sieved and drained into the bucket. 
This is important to avoid any accidents, spills, and contamination.</p>

<h3>Step 12: Prepare Your Containers</h3>

<p>You're almost done honey harvesting! After draining all the honey from the 
extractor, let the honey settle for 12-18 hours to get rid of air bubbles. 
Meanwhile, you can prepare the containers you will use to store your honey. You 
should wash and air-dry every honey container, including the jugs you will use.</p>

<h3>Step 13: Package Your Honey</h3>

<p>Finish by filling up the containers, labeling them, and sharing, selling, or 
storing the honey. You can use different types of containers depending on what 
you want to do with it. If you want to sell the honey, glass jars are the best. 
You can also use plastic squeeze containers. You'll also need to label your honey. 
You can make custom labels online or pre-order customized honey jar labels from 
beekeeping sites. Whichever option you choose, make sure it makes sense financially 
and matches your preferences. Don't forget to share your honey with your neighbors, 
friends, and family.</p>
