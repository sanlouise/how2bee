<p>Beekeeping has been around for over 5,000 years, becoming essential to ancient 
Egypt, ancient China, ancient Greece, and many other civilizations along the way. 
Honey has long been used as a sugar substitute, especially since many civilizations
did not have access to sugar. On top of that, the golden substance we've all come 
to know and love has been used in cosmetics, medicines, and even to make alcoholic 
beverages (particularly in Greece around 2000 BC).[1] In light of the influence 
honey has had on civilization, it makes sense that some of history's more influential 
figures would have also had a fascination with bees.</p>

<p>Although this list includes only a few of the famous individuals throughout 
history who kept bees, some of the names may surprise you! Here's the list of 
famous beekeepers (or bee enthusiasts!) in no particular order…</p>

<h2>10. Aristotle</h2>

<p>Aristotle was very passionate about apiculture, honey bees, and he worked closely 
together with countless beekeepers. In fact, he made several theories about the 
behavior and even the origin of bees. For example, he thought bees came from the 
flowers of brooms, reeds, and olives! While this may sound ridiculous to us (and 
it is a bit ridiculous), the reason why he believed this is quite interesting.</p>

<p>First, he noticed that every time there was a large harvest of olives there were 
also significantly more bees swarming. This led him to believe that bees spontaneously 
generate from flowers. But many of his other observations were more accurate.</p>

<p>He also noticed that the more the flower Thyme bloomed, the better the honey 
yield beekeepers could expect, which allowed Aristotle to forecast honey yields. 
But his observations did not stop there, as he then developed an entire list of 
flowers that bees thrive on (and that make delicious honey) when placed around 
their hives.</p>

<p>In addition, Aristotle observed that bees flew only to a single species of plant 
for each individual flight and even described bees obtaining pollen (which he 
mistakenly called wax) from flowers with their front feet and pushing it to their 
hind legs. He also believed that honey was gathered from bees' mouths and vomited 
into the cells of the honey comb.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, his last conclusion was that honey combs came from tree gum and 
that honey is created by something that falls from the air. Sadly, Aristotle never 
understood the correlation between bees, pollination, and flowering, but he was 
still deeply intrigued by them![2]</p>

<p>One thing is for certain - Aristotle loved bees <strong>much</strong> more than 
hornets and wasps.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Concerning the generation of animals akin to them, as hornets and 
wasps, the facts in all cases are similar to a certain extent, but are devoid of 
the extraordinary features which characterize bees; this we should expect, for 
they have nothing divine about them as the bees have." ~ Aristotle 384 BC – 322 
BC</p></blockquote>

<h2>9. Thomas Jefferson</h2>

<p><em>Apis mellifera</em>, or what we call the 'honey bee,' first arrived in North 
America around the 1600s together with European colonists. The New World was known 
as <em>the land of milk and honey</em> but, as the New World did not naturally 
have bees, European settlers brought honey bees to ensure the ideal remained 
(honey is delectable after all). The honey bee began to spread throughout the 
New World as quickly as European settlements expanded into the new territory.[3]</p>

<p>Edmund Bacon (1785-1866), Thomas Jefferson's overseer, is known to have been a 
beekeeper. While Thomas Jefferson himself was in all likelihood not a beekeeper, 
he did comment a few times about bees, beekeeping, and honey. 'Honey was a better 
substitute for sugar than any other preparation.'</p>

<p>Another famous comment made by Thomas Jefferson is quite interesting. Native 
Americans called honey bees the white man's fly and 'considered their approach as 
indicating the approach of the settlements of the whites.'[4] Thus, it could even 
be argued that apiculture was widespread among European settlers when expanding 
into the New World as honey was the perfect substitute for sugar at the time.</p>

<h2>8. George Washington</h2>

<p>As the first President of the United States, one would think George Washington 
was entirely too busy to concern himself with bees. But he wasn't. In 1787, 
President Washington even had an apiary constructed on the Mount Vernon property 
that he had inherited. Today, a replica sits in the place of the beehives on the 
grounds of Mount Vernon.</p>

<p>Here's a fun fact. President Washington's hives, along with many of the beehives 
in the southern states in the late 1700s, were made out of black gum from trees. 
The reason for this was because the heartwood decays quickly, which leaves a hollow 
trunk that is perfect as a beehive. These black gum beehives became known as 'gums,' 
which is why the word is now used generally for any hive.[5]</p>

<h2>7. Napoleon Bonaparte</h2>

<p>Napoleon Bonaparte is one of the most famous French military and political leaders 
in history. Apart from expanding France's political boundaries with multiple wars, 
Napoleon also deeply desired for France's culture to grow and flourish. And he did 
this with the symbol of an insect — the honey bee.</p>

<p>The 'Golden Bee' was Napoleon's and France's emblem during the Napoleonic era. In 
1804, when Napoleon was crowned Emperor of the French, he wore purple robes that 
were embroidered everywhere with the 'Golden Bee' symbol. Napoleon respected bees 
as they were orderly, efficient, and worked without question for the good of the 
colony. Many believe he desired the French to be the same.[6]</p>

<h2>6. Ben Franklin</h2>

<p>Legend has it that Benjamin Franklin briefly became passionate about beekeeping. 
As for many beginner beekeepers, Ben was not fond of the idea of getting stung by
a bee and, back in the 18th Century, getting stung was almost certain for beekeepers 
as bee suits were not widely used.</p>

<p>So Ben went to the drawing board and began to develop a piece of equipment that 
would forever change beekeeping – the <strong>crotchless</strong> bee suit.</p>

<p><em>Crotchless</em>? Apparently, Ben suffered from massive bladder stones in the 
years leading up to his death in 1790. Perhaps because of this (and perhaps not), 
Ben designed his bee suit to allow for quick urination whenever the need arose.</p>

<p>What Ben may not have expected, however, is that after the first time he used it 
a bee landed on his… well, you get the point. After this rather uncomfortable 
experience, Ben forgot about the bee suit and instead invented the first medical 
catheter. While bees probably were not Ben's forte, beekeeping may have influenced 
his other more notable inventions that changed the world as we know it.[7]</p>

<blockquote><p>'Tart words make no friends; a spoonful of honey will catch more 
flies than a gallon of vinegar.' ~ Benjamin Franklin</p></blockquote>

<h2>5. Thomas Edison</h2>

<p>Thomas Edison is famous for his thousands of inventions, including the light bulb 
– but he's not famous for beekeeping. Nonetheless, his estate in Fort Myers, Florida, 
has kept and continues to keep bees in order to pollinate the numerous flowers on 
the property. Although this does not necessarily confirm that Thomas Edison was a 
beekeeper, there's a good chance he studied them due to his curious nature.[8]</p>

<h2>4. Sherlock Holmes</h2>

<p>Sir Conan Doyle, the author of the Sherlock Holmes series, is an amateur detective 
and an excellent novelist to say the least. However, he is also an avid bee enthusiast.</p>

<p>Many fans of Sherlock Holmes know that a few years after Doyle attempted to kill 
Holmes at the Reichenback Falls, Doyle instead decided to send Holmes into retirement 
in Sussex where he would spend the rest of his days as a beekeeper. It's rather easy
to envision Holmes conducting more than a few experiments on his beloved bees, but 
we at How 2 Bee are certain that they are experiments to help the bees.[9]</p>

<h2>3. Jon Bon Jovi</h2>

<p>It's fairly well-known that Jon Bon Jovi is also a famous beekeeper. But there 
may be more than meets the eye as to why he does.</p>

<p>New Jersey. 1964. As the state attempted to encourage more farming, New Jersey 
granted tax exemptions (up to 98% in some cases) to citizens that produced more 
than $500 in agricultural revenue from more than five acres of land. But as of 
August, 2015, that subsidy changed.</p>

<p>Now, New Jersey grants tax exemptions only to citizens that make more than $1,000 
in agricultural revenue. Not only that, but now citizens that want to qualify must 
also submit proof of farming revenue and agree to being inspected regularly. Although 
the increase of this agricultural revenue needed for the tax exemptions is not much, 
the change seeks to separate the fake farmers (and rockstars!) from the real ones.</p>

<p>Jon Bon Jovi is probably living on much more than just a prayer, as he paid only 
$104 on 7.1 acres of land in 2010, part of which was used to keep bees.[10]</p>

<h2>2. Scarlett Johansson</h2>

<p>Hollywood stars are getting into beekeeping. Even the actor Samuel L. Jackson 
got Scarlett Johansson and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, a beehive as a wedding 
present.</p>

[IMG]

<p>Apparently, Samuel L. Jackson is even quoted with saying that,</p>

<blockquote><p>'Scarlett was always talking about how the bees were dying and the 
planet was going to die.' [11]</p></blockquote>

<h2>1. Morgan Freeman</h2>

<p>Morgan Freeman began beekeeping in July, 2014 and he already feels a deep connection 
with his honey bees. While it may seem odd that there are so many famous beekeepers, 
beekeeping is an age-old practice that truly everyone benefits from.</p>

<h2>Conclusion & Sources</h2>

<p>Countless famous individuals from history became fascinated by bees. And it's 
easy to understand why. Brigham Young, Hippocrates, Martha Stewart, Sylvia Plath,
Neil Gaiman, Chris Fairbank, and Democritus are only a few famous people that are 
reported to have kept bees.</p>
