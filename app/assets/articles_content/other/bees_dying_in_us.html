<p>It's in the news - and it's important. Many people around the world are now 
asking the question, "<em>why are bees dying</em>?" The answer is not simple. 
But you should know more about this problem because you can help solve it.</p>

<p>So let's give a bit of background to the problem, the impact of bees dying, 
and the top 6 causes for bees dying. We'll even offer a potential solution at 
the end, which could seriously save the bees with your help.</p>

[TOC]

<h2>The Rise of a Serious Problem</h2>

<p>Bee populations have been declining steadily in the U.S. for more than a decade. 
The current crisis dates back to the Autumn season in 2006 when beekeepers around 
the United States reported massive losses in bee populations. During this period, 
the U.S. lost an average of more than 30% of its hives and up to 90% in some cases. 
Although it varied case-by-case, bees would typically leave their hives to forage 
but they would never come back.</p>

<p>Beekeepers in many regions were finding empty hives except for a few adult bees 
and a live queen. In most of these cases, there were no bee corpses remaining to 
tell the tale of what happened. The losses were fast and unprecedented. Scientists 
rushed to research and even recommend solutions to solve the issue of why bees were 
dying. But, although there were numerous recommendations, very little was done in 
the U.S. to solve the growing problem.</p>

<p>European beekeepers experienced the same problem with bees dying around the same 
time. Unlike the U.S., the European Union (EU) was quick to take serious steps. For 
example, the EU has already announced a ban on a new class of pesticides known as 
neonicotinoids. According to the EU, neonicotinoids are responsible for most cases 
on declining bee populations in Europe.[1]</p>

<p>The U.S. hasn't taken similar measures despite many environmental and consumer 
groups as well as U.S. beekeeping associations who have already sued the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for failing to do enough to safeguard bees 
from harmful pesticides.</p>

<p>It wasn't until May, 2015 that the U.S. government finally gave the subject of 
declining bee populations the seriousness it deserves. The Obama Administration 
recently announced plans to make millions of acres of federal land more friendly 
to bees. The administration has also promised to increase research funding and 
put in stringent measures to discourage use of pesticides.[2] Although most people 
welcome this move, some argue that it's too late considering the damage is already 
done and bees face other enemies today.</p>

<p>The most recent studies on the causes of bees dying in the U.S. today reveal 
that a disease known as <strong>colony collapse disorder (CCD)</strong> is in fact 
more deadly than pesticides when it comes to the major causes of 
<a href="http://how2bee.com/bees-in-winter">Wintering Bees</a>, according to the 
latest honey bee population survey conducted by the AIA (Apiary Inspectors of 
America) and the USDA (U.S. Department of Agriculture).[3] Making more land 
available for beekeeping may not, therefore, be the solution to the increase of 
bees dying in the U.S.</p>

<p>Most beekeepers consider a 15% loss in their hive population to be acceptable 
every year, especially when wintering their bees (linked to above). In the U.S., 
honey bees are still fighting for their lives as honey bee colonies are weaker 
now more than ever before in the U.S. Only time will tell whether the 
<strong>$3 million USDA subsidy</strong> offered in early 2014 will help to 
increase the honey bee populations in America.</p>

<p>The program is meant to attract cattle ranchers and Midwest dairy farmers to 
reseed their farms with bee-friendly crops like clover and alfalfa which offer 
perfect habitats for honey bees to thrive.</p>

<p>By the way, this isn't the first time the U.S. faces a problem involving bees 
dying. The problem can be traced back to the 1880's as well as the 1920's and the 
1960's. The U.S. also experienced declining bee population problems in the mid 
1990's where Pennsylvania beekeepers lost more than 50% of their bee colonies 
without one clear cause. During this period, a 
<a href="http://how2bee.com/bee-diseases-and-bee-predators">Top Bee Diseases and 
Predators</a> (in particular, the tracheal and Varroa mites) hit honey bees hard.</p>

<p>These parasites continue to affect honey bees today, which have certainly given 
many beekeepers a few sleepless nights. The sudden amount of bees dying in the 
U.S. can't be attributed to solely one cause. Many factors have contributed to 
this problem, including habitat loss and global warming, although pesticides and 
CCD are among the main causes of declining honey bee populations in the U.S.</p>

<h2>Bees Dying and What it Means for You</h2>

<p>You may be asking yourself, "<strong>why is the U.S. and the world at large 
even worried about declining bee populations</strong>?" Well, the answer is that 
bees play crucial roles in our daily life, particularly because they are 
<em>pollinators</em>. The large quantity of bees dying are causing an unprecedented 
pollination crisis. Below is a brief discussion about this impact and what this 
means for you.</p>

<h3>An Unprecedented Pollination Crisis</h3>

<p>Western nations like the U.S. rely heavily on bees to drive the commercial 
agriculture industry. According to the most recent USDA studies, honey bees 
contribute <strong>more than $15 billion</strong> of America's commercial food 
production.[4]</p>

<p>This represents approximately <em>one third of all food produced in the U.S</em>. 
These foods include some of our most favorite summer fruits like strawberries and 
blueberries as well as guar beans (which are used in countless products) and many 
other types of food - and all of them depend on pollination. On average, bees are 
responsible for pollinating approximately 100 key crops, and these crops total 
approximately 90% of the U.S. nutrition.[5]</p>

<p>Let's give a quick scenario. If there were no bees in the U.S., there would be 
a pollination crisis that could easily lead to a shortage in fresh fruits, 
vegetables, and nuts, which are heavily dependent on insect pollination. Although 
some people may argue that there are other ways of pollinating crops that don't 
rely on bees, the U.S. stands to lose out on the production of many healthy foods 
like cherries, broccoli, onions, among many other types of produce. This will 
happen as the increase of bees dying forces the rise of other pollination 
methods.</p>

<h3>And You Thought 2008 Was Bad?</h3>

<p>Another significant impact of bees dying in the U.S. is increased food prices. 
Bees pollinate crops for free. Artificial pollination methods result in increased 
food production costs, which eventually results in increased food prices.</p>

<p>The U.S. might even be forced to increase imports of some foods to sustain demand 
if honey bee populations keep declining. This would also result in increased food 
prices.</p>

<p>The cost of beekeeping has also increased drastically as a result of declining 
bee populations. Even though the USDA is giving incentives to promote beekeeping, 
honey bees in the U.S. are having trouble finding enough to forage. As a result, 
<a href="http://how2bee.com/how-to-raise-honey-bees">beekeepers must purchase more 
bee food</a> to sustain their bees when their colony can't produce enough honey 
to survive throughout the seasons.[6]</p>

<p>This might come as a surprise, but bees dying also has a negative impact on 
employment. Bees employ many people - beekeepers, sellers of beekeeping supplies 
and equipment, farmers who rely on bee pollination, people who sell honey and 
other bee products, among other professions. Therefore, an increase in bees dying 
in the U.S. can result in significant job losses in the industry and other related 
industries since bees create thousands of jobs. The economic effect of there being
no honey bees in the U.S. is catastrophic from an employment standpoint.</p>

<p>It's also important to remember that honey bees contribute more than $15 billion 
to the U.S. economy through their vital role of keeping fresh fruits, vegetables, 
and nuts in our diets.</p>

<h3>Do You Feel... Unhealthy?</h3>

<p>Considering honey bees are responsible for producing approximately 90% of the 
U.S. nutrition, a steady increase in bees dying would obviously result in nutrition 
problems for millions of Americans. Fresh fruits, vegetables, and nuts are some of
the most nutritious foods and bees are responsible for pollinating most (if not 
all) of these foods.</p>

<p>If there were no bees in the U.S., most fresh fruit, vegetables, and nuts 
produced wouldn't meet the nutritional threshold for healthy foods even if other 
pollination methods were used. This could then lead to an increase in medical 
problems.</p>

<h3>National Food Security Problem</h3>

<p>Insect pollination of plants, flowers, trees, (which is done mostly by bees) 
is crucial to U.S. food security. Honey bees enable the production of approximately 
100 crops in the U.S. Globally, honey bees are responsible for pollinating around 
35% of all crops. If there continues to be an increase in bees dying, this would 
lead to food security problems in the U.S. and potentially the world at large.</p>

<h2>Top 6 Reasons for Bees Dying</h2>

<p>There are many reasons behind decreasing bee populations in the U.S. and worldwide. 
These reasons range from pesticides to common honey bee diseases to problems like 
Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). Below is a list of the top 6 reasons, in no 
particular order, for a sharp increase of bees dying in the U.S.</p>

<h3>Pesticides</h3>

<p>Many studies indicate that pesticides are a major cause of bees dying in the 
U.S. However, most pesticides aren't a direct cause of bees dying. Many studies 
indicate that pesticides kill bees indirectly - prolonged exposure to pesticides 
cause bees to become more susceptible to other bee diseases. One such study 
indicated that bees exposed to lethal doses of pesticides, such as 
<strong>neonicotinoids</strong>, for a prolonged period of time become easily 
infected by a common bee parasite: Nosema.</p>

<p>Neonicotinoids have also been found to fog the brains of honey bees altering 
their behavior in the process. For instance, neonicotinoids have also been found 
to keep honey bees from supplying their beehives with enough food to sustain the
hives, often times causing the collapse of the colony.[7]</p>

<h3>Harsh Chemicals</h3>

<p>Pesticides aren't the only chemicals responsible for bees dying in the U.S. 
Bees come into contact with many chemicals today. For instance, commercial beehives 
are fumigated regularly with chemicals to keep off mites, among other destructive 
hive insects and pests. Bees also come into direct contact with many genetically 
modified crops today, which are packed with chemicals resulting in the spread of 
pollen that has significantly less nutritional value.</p>

<p>Many studies suggest that the build-up of genetically modified pollen as well 
as synthetic chemicals is stressing bee populations across the U.S., which in the 
end cause an increase of bees dying. This theory has been universally accepted 
since organic bee colonies that aren't exposed to chemicals and genetically modified 
crops experience a survival rate much better than that of regular honey bee 
colonies.[8]</p>

<p>Furthermore, typical bee pollen today contains over 150 different chemical residues
from pesticides and other chemicals which are inevitable for profitable agribusiness. 
In a nutshell, <strong>the current agricultural system's use of chemicals must change 
to increase bee populations</strong>.</p>

<h3>Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD)</h3>

<p>CCD is also responsible for bees dying in the U.S to a great extent. CCD is 
characterised by bee colonies disappearing abruptly. There are many causes of 
CCD with the most notable being pesticides (neonicotinoids), Varroa mite infections, 
malnutrition, pathogens, and genetic factors (such as immuno-deficiencies).</p>

<p>Some studies also indicate that CCD is caused by changing beekeeping practices 
or a combination of two or more of the above factors. However, the search for a 
specific cause of CCD is still ongoing. Scientists are looking for a commonality 
that will lead to a specific cause.[9]</p>

<h3>Radiation</h3>

<p>Radiation has also been linked to the increase of bees dying in the U.S. Bees 
are known to be vulnerable to atmospheric electromagnetic radiation, which is 
increasing as the number of mobile phones and wireless communication towers 
increases. The radiation theory suggests that radiation interferes with the 
navigation systems of bees preventing them from being able to find their way 
back to their hives. As improbable as this theory seems, there is evidence backing 
this theory which has also been linked to CCD.[10]</p>

<h3>Climate Change</h3>

<p>Studies also suggest that global warming is partly to blame for a significant 
number of bees dying in the U.S. and the world at large. This may be attributed 
to the fact that global warming has increased the growth rate of pathogens like 
viruses, mites, and fungi known to attack bee colonies. The unusual hot and cold 
winter weather fluctuations experienced in the recent years may also be affecting 
bee populations negatively given the fact that bees thrive in consistent weather 
patterns.[11]</p>

<h3>Habitat Loss</h3>

<p>Most of the suitable natural habitats for bees in North America has been 
transformed into industrial parks, office complexes, houses, highways, and malls. 
Urbanization causes bee deaths by destroying bee habitats directly. Urbanization 
also isolates and fragments the land where bees used to forage. In turn, this 
reduces the genetic diversity of certain bee species, which eventually results 
in bees dying since bees have a harder time getting mates. Also, the resulting 
bees are more susceptible to diseases among other problems since they aren't 
genetically diverse.[12]</p>

<h2>A Potential Solution: Make Your Own Personal Apiary!</h2>

<h3>How Apiaries Help in Increasing Honey Bee Populations</h3>

<p>An apiary is another name for a bee yard where honey bees are 
<a href="http://how2bee.com/top-10-beekeeping-supplies">Your Beekeeping Supplies & 
Equipment</a>. Beekeepers can set up apiaries on their own farms, rent land to set 
up apiaries, and many do it in the middle of the city. Some farmers provide land 
for setting up apiaries for free because they stand to enjoy pollination benefits. 
Others ask for honey or money as rent for using the land.</p>

<p>Apiaries are helping to increase the population of honey bees in the U.S. simply 
because they provide perfect environments for honey bees to thrive. The $3 million
USDA subsidy offered in early 2014 is encouraging cattle ranchers and Midwest dairy
farmers to set up apiaries while also encouraging farmers to reseed with bee-friendly
crops like clover and alfalfa, among other bee-friendly crops to create perfect 
habitats for honey bees to thrive.</p>

<p>The more people that become beekeepers, the more people will better understand 
what is causing the increase of bees dying, which means the better we will be able 
to solve the problem. Honey bees need your help. Even one person can make a 
difference, and it could even be a <strong>fun problem to solve</strong> when you 
start your own apiary.</p>

<h3>Setting up an Apiary: What you Need to Know</h3>

<p>Setting up an apiary is highly recommendable, especially if you are in some of 
the best honey production areas in the U.S., such as Texas, Florida, California, 
and the Upper-Midwest areas. Nevertheless, you can set up an apiary anywhere in 
the U.S. - even in the city if you have enough space.</p>

<p>Setting up an apiary is highly recommended if you want to make a positive 
contribution to pollination. You can also set up an apiary to benefit financially 
from paid pollination in areas like California, the Great Lakes, the Pacific 
Northwest, and the Northeast regions. You may consider setting up an apiary for 
other reasons, such as queen bee mating and rearing.</p>

<p>The factors to consider when setting up an apiary aren't very different from the 
factors to consider when setting up typical beehives. For instance, you need to 
choose a site with plenty of pollen and nectar, particularly if you want to set 
up your apiary in the city or a place with scarce pollen and nectar. Apiaries also 
need an adequate supply of clean water. Refer to our articles on 
<a href="http://how2bee.com/how-to-start-a-beehive">How to Start a Beehive</a> and 
<a href="http://how2bee.com/how-to-start-beekeeping">how to start beekeeping</a>
for more information.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there are some import factors you must consider when setting up 
an apiary. For instance, the number of hives that should be placed in an apiary 
varies depending on factors like the size of the area, the nectar and pollen 
sources, the bee species, etc. If an apiary has too many hives, there will be 
stiff competition for resources, which will lead to low honey yields as well as 
a higher disease transmission rate.</p>

<p>Apiaries should have 25 to 40 hives, although migrating beekeepers can have 
more hives in one apiary located in an area with favorable nectar flow (places 
where a large amount of nectar is produced by plants, flowers, trees, among others). 
However, the general rule of thumb is one hive per acre.</p>

<p>With the above guidelines and information from our other beekeeping articles 
and <a href="http://how2bee.com/beekeeping-books">beekeeping books</a>, you shouldn't 
have a problem starting an apiary. Together we can help out the bees, help solve 
the problem of bees dying in the U.S., and even enjoy some sweet delicious honey 
in the meantime.</p>
