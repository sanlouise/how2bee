<p>Sweet delicious honey is the <em>ultimate reward</em> for most beekeepers. 
After working hard month-after-month, you'll definitely want to reap the fruits 
of your labor. To get everything right, you must first determine the best time 
for harvesting honey from your beehives. There is a common misconception that 
hives are filled with honey throughout the year. This is far from the truth. 
Harvesting honey from your beehives can only occur at specific times during the 
year. Knowing when to harvest is the first step to ensure your

bee colony's survival throughout the year</a>.</p>

<h2>Harvesting Honey at the Correct Time</h2>

<p>Beekeepers should start harvesting honey at the end of a nectar flow as this 
is when hives are filled with honey. However, there isn't a specific time when 
the nectar flow ends as it differs depending on the weather conditions in your 
region. In most places, honey harvesting is done in late summer since new colonies 
need time (at least a full season) to increase in number and gather plenty of 
honey for the winter.</p>

<p>You should check your hive in late summer to examine if your bees have been 
able to fill all their frames with capped honey. If a shallow frame has at least 
80% capped honey, you should consider harvesting it. At the same time, you should 
wait until all frames are filled with honey and the major nectar flow is complete 
before you harvest.[1]</p>

<p>Even when all your frames are filled, you may want to consider some factors 
before you start harvesting honey, especially if you are after quality over 
quantity. For instance, honey that's present in open cells isn't always ready for 
harvesting if it isn't cured. To inspect if such honey is cured, shake the frame 
gently to see if honey leaks freely from the cells. If it does, the honey hasn't 
been cured, which means that it shouldn't be extracted yet.</p>

<p>Uncured honey is simply nectar that's not cured yet. It's really not even honey 
since it has a very high water content. Harvesting honey that's uncured usually 
results in low-quality honey that resembles watery syrup. Also, uncured honey tends 
to ferment and spoil easily. Therefore, it's in your best interest to wait until 
all of it is cured if you are keen on getting high-quality honey. But don't leave 
the honey in the hive too long. If you don't use it, you'll lose it![2]</p>

<h2>Harvesting Honey at the Wrong Time</h2>

<p>Waiting for too long to harvest gives rise to two main problems.</p>

<p><strong>The bees may start only eating the honey.</strong> Following a major 
nectar flow, pollen and nectar become scarce. You can bet if there's a ton of 
honey in the hive, your bees will definitely prefer eating it over traveling for 
miles to forage scarce nectar and pollen.</p>

<p><strong>The weather may become unfavorable for harvesting honey.</strong> After 
summer, the temperature gets colder. At a certain point, any honey that is present 
in the combs will thicken and even granulate, making it extremely difficult to 
extract. Honey harvesting is easiest during the summer because warm honey flows 
easily.</p>

<h2>How to Start Harvesting Honey</h2>

<p>Since you already know the best time to harvest honey, let's now move to 
choosing honey harvesting and extraction tools. To extract honey effectively, you 
need two main types of equipment: honey harvesting and honey extraction equipment.</p>

<h3>Honey Harvesting Equipment</h3>

<p>Honey harvesting equipment consists of five main pieces:</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>The Bee Suit</em>: to protect your body from bee stings.</li>
  <li><em>The Smoker</em>: to calm your honey bees as you harvest.</li>
  <li><em>The Frame Supers</em>: to hold your honey combs.</li>
  <li><em>The Gloves</em>: to protect your hands from bee stings.</li>
  <li><em>The Hive Tool</em>: to scrape wax, move frames, etc.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Honey Extraction Equipment</h3>

<p>Honey extraction equipment consists of seven main pieces:</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>The Heated Uncapping Knife</em>: to unseal or open honey cells. Wax 
  capping on honey combs create airtight seals on honey cells. Before any honey 
  can be extracted, these lids must be removed. The easiest and most effective 
  way to remove these lids is by using a heated uncapping knife. Heated uncapping 
  knives are best suited for the job because they slice cleanly and fast through 
  most of the capping. You can use a heated knife instead of a heated uncapping 
  knife, but you may risk experiencing results that are far from perfect.</li>
  
  <li><em>The Uncapping Fork</em>: to unseal or open honey cells missed by the 
  heated uncapping knife. The heated uncapping knife won't open all honey cells. 
  This is where the uncapping fork comes in handy.</li>
  
  <li><em>The Tub</em>: to store wax honey and wax cappings. Tubs are useful when 
  you want to make different types of honey.</li>
  
  <li>
    <em>The Extractor</em>: to extract the honey.
    
    <p>Honey extractors are devices that spin combs using centrifugal force so that 
    the honey flies off of them. Honey extractors come in different styles and sizes 
    to meet your unique needs and budget. It's quite easy to get a honey extractor that 
    perfectly suits your needs. The best extractors are those that are capable of 
    fitting at least 4 standard hive frames at a time, though they typically compromise 
    on stability and sturdiness. Most beekeepers go with

    <em>this popular honey extractor</em></a> that can efficiently handle 2 frames at 
    a time while still being affordable for those wanting to get the most from their 
    bees.</p>
    
    <p>You shouldn't worry if you can't buy your own honey extractors. Nature centers, 
    local beekeepers, and 
    <a href="http://how2bee.com/beekeepers-associations-laws/" title="Local Beekeepers Associations">
    local beekeepers associations usually have honey extractors</a> that you can rent. 
    You may want to call around in advance to weigh your options. However, you will 
    need to get your own honey extractor in the long-term if you are serious about 
    beekeeping.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li><em>The Food-Grade Bucket</em>: to store honey from the extractor.</li>
  
  <li><em>The Double Sieve</em>: to catch wax and impurities present in the honey 
  poured from an extractor.</li>
  
  <li><em>The Containers</em>: to store honey before consumption or selling it.</li>

<h2>Types of Honey to Harvest</h2>

<p>Before you start harvesting honey, you should be aware of the various types of 
honey you can harvest. There are four main types: extracted honey, comb honey, 
chunk honey and whip honey. Let's take a brief look at each of these types.</p>

[IMG]

<h3>Extracted Honey</h3>

<p>Extracted honey is undoubtedly the most popular type of harvested honey today 
thanks to its pure and high-quality nature. To harvest this type of honey, you 
need an extractor. You also need an uncapping knife (to remove wax capping off 
honeycombs) and a double sieve (to remove any impurities that may be present in 
the honey from the extractor).</p>

<h3>Comb Honey</h3>

<p>As the name suggests, comb honey is honey that is still lodged in combs. To 
harvest comb honey, you need a strong nectar flow characterized by many sunny days 
and 'perfect' rainfall to produce plenty of flowering plants. Comb honey takes 
less time to harvest compared to extracted honey. You just need to remove the entire 
comb and package it. Comb honey is eaten whole (both the wax and honey).</p>

<h3>Chuck Honey</h3>

<p>Chunk honey is simply comb honey that is packaged in smaller pieces or chunks. 
Chunk honey is usually stored or packaged in wide-mouthed bottles, which are then 
filled with extracted honey.</p>

<h3>Whipped Honey</h3> 

<p>Whipped honey is also known as spun honey, candied honey, churned honey, creamed 
honey, or honey fondant (a semi-solid type of honey popular in Europe). The honey 
naturally forms crystals or coarse granules. It is made by controlling the honey 
crystallization process. Whipped honey is made by blending 9 parts of extracted 
honey with one part of granulated or crystallized honey.</p>
