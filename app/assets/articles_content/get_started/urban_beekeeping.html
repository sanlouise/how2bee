<p>Urban beekeeping is exactly what it sounds like - keeping bees in urban areas. 
Urban beekeeping is a relatively new concept that is gaining popularity very fast 
in the U.S. and other parts of the world, including Europe. As urbanization takes 
a toll on the natural bee habitats in the U.S. and Europe, many concerned citizens 
are looking for ways to counteract the alarming trend of declining bee populations. 
Urban beekeeping is one of the best ways to increase bee populations given that 
urban areas host the majority of the people in the U.S. today.[1]</p>

<h2>Urban Beekeeping vs. Normal Beekeeping</h2>

<p>It's impossible to do normal beekeeping in urban areas because of the limited 
amount of space. Urban beekeeping makes everyone a potential beekeeper regardless 
of your location (but of course if you live where it's very cold or very hot, it 
may be more difficult). If you are concerned about declining bee populations 
globally and you want to do something about it, you can become an urban beekeeper.

guide</a> to get vital information on how to get started!</p>

<p>Urban beekeeping is way more effective in the U.S nowadays than normal beekeeping 
since most people live in urban areas. Also, most natural bee habitats in the U.S. 
have been destroyed to pave way for urbanization. For example, housing and infrastructure 
projects destroy the nature the bees used to use for gathering pollen and nectar.</p>

<h2>So how easy is it to start urban beekeeping?</h2>

<p>Want to know how you can start urban beekeeping? Below are some simple steps to
follow.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Do your research. Is it legal?</h3>

<p>Before you start urban beekeeping, it's crucial that you carry out thorough 
research on <a href="http://how2bee.com/beekeepers-associations-laws/">local beekeeping 
regulations</a> and ordinances. This step is mandatory to avoid legal problems. 
Urban areas usually have beekeeping regulations, which must be adhered to if you're 
keen on keeping bees legally in your backyard or rooftop. You can go online and 
even visit your local authorities to get familiar with the local beekeeping laws 
in your area.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Consult Your Neighbors.</h3>

<p>This is another crucial step to consider. Although local laws may not stop you 
from keeping bees on the rooftop or in the backyard of your urban home, it's 
important to get the consent of your neighbors so they don't get angry at you for 
the extra bees flying around. Urban settings are usually characterized by houses 
that are close to each other. That means you should be courteous and just inform 
your neighbors that your planning to start beekeeping to avoid surprising them. 
Urban beekeeping is safe when you follow the correct urban beekeeping practices. 
Your neighbors usually won't have any problems. But even better, you can offer 
free honey to them as an incentive to let you raise bees!</p>

<h3>Step 3: Identify a Suitable Location.</h3>

<p>After your neighbors are fully aware of your beekeeping plans, you can start 
finding a suitable location for your hives. Urban beekeepers have two main options 
when choosing hive locations. You can put your hives either on 1) your rooftop or 
2) in your backyard. Your choice should be made based on the type of house you 
live in. If you live in a flat, your best option is the rooftop. But if you have
an urban house, it may be your best option to just place it in your backyard or 
garden.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Prepare Your Location.</h3>

<p>Once you have a suitable location, the next step is preparing the location. 
If you want to keep bees in your backyard, you'll need to prepare your backyard 
by building a high fence around your hives (about 8 feet tall) to give your bees 
a safe flight path in and out of the hive.</p>

<p>This step is crucial for ensuring your bees never bump into people. In regards 
to rooftop beekeeping, this step isn't necessary since rooftops are high and 
people rarely access them. You do, however, need to ensure your rooftop is clean 
and that your hive is placed securely to avoid it falling when the wind picks up, 
which would be horrible.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Buy Your Beehive.</h3>

<p>You should now buy a beehive once you know where you're going to place it. There 
are many types of hives that are suitable for urban beekeeping. Your choice should 
be guided by the available space, your budget, type of bees you want to keep, size 
of colony, and even your personal tastes and preferences. You can buy a 
<a href="http://www.1automationwiz.com/app/?Clk=5424024">high quality beehive at 
an incredibly affordable price here</a>.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Buy Your Bees.</h3>

<p>Gentle bees are perfect for urban beekeeping because they have a low temperament. 
If you get gentle honey bees, you don't have to worry as much about them being 
aggressive and stinging your neighbors. Gentle bees are also great for urban beekeeping 
because they are good pollinators.[2] This makes them the perfect choice for potential 
beekeepers who want to make a positive difference on bee population.</p>

<h3>Step 7: Buy Bee Suits and Beekeeping Supplies.</h3>

<p>You will need a bee suit as well as 
<a href="http://how2bee.com/top-10-beekeeping-supplies/">essential beekeeping equipment, 
such as a hive tool and smoker</a>. A hive tool is handy because it is multipurpose 
in nature. A smoker is also essential when inspecting a hive. You don't need to 
invest in equipment such as a honey extractor immediately (especially since they're 
expensive!). You can borrow one from other beekeepers in your area during your 
first harvest as you plan to buy yours.</p>

<p>You could also settle for a half bee suit with gloves instead of a full beekeeping 
suit (just remember to wear thick pants like jeans). A half bee suit is equally effective 
and cheaper than a full bee suit. It's perfect for urban beekeeping on a budget.</p>

<h2>Common Urban Beekeeping Problems & Solutions</h2>

<h3>Bee Stings</h3>

<p>This is by far the most common urban beekeeping problem. Many urban beekeepers 
are prone to get into legal problems because of stray bees stinging their neighbors. 
This is precisely why it's important to do thorough research and ensure you keep 
bees legally. Proper hive placement is also crucial for avoiding stings since it 
ensures bees don't bump into people easily on sidewalks, roads, nearby properties, 
etc. Stings can also be avoided by keeping the right bees, such as gentle bees, 
that aren't as aggressive.</p>

<h3>City-Specific Legal Issues</h3>

<p>Many urban beekeepers are prone to being sued. To avoid this, you should ensure 
you follow local laws and regulations on urban beekeeping. Being a member of a 
local beekeeping group can also help you avoid legal problems since such groups 
have structures in place to handle these types of problems on behalf of members.</p>

<h3>Overcrowding</h3>

<p>The increasing popularity of beekeeping in the city poses overcrowding risks 
for other pollinators, such as various species of butterflies among other insect 
pollinators. The best solution to this problem is planting more wildflowers. You 
shouldn't <em>just</em> set up a hive. You should actually 
<a href="http://how2bee.com/bee-friendly-plants/">plant some bee friendly plants</a>
in your yard or rooftop terrace to avoid overcrowding, which occurs when bees fight 
for limited food sources.</p>

<h2>Cities in the U.S. that Allow Urban Beekeeping</h2>

<p>Most U.S. cities in North America prohibited beekeeping in the past. But that's 
beginning to change. In recent years, beekeepers managed to overturn bee bans in 
a number of cities. Urban beekeeping is now legal in multiple cities provided it 
is done in a regulated manner.</p>

<p>For instance, urban beekeepers are required to register their beehives in most 
cities. Some of the major cities in the U.S. allowing urban beekeeping include: 
<strong>Salt Lake City, New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Denver, Seattle, 
Minneapolis</strong> and <strong>Santa Monica</strong>. But you'll need a permit 
to keep bees in these areas.</p>

<h3>How do I know if it's legal where I live?</h3>

<p>Local laws on urban beekeeping are readily available online on local government 
websites. Local beekeeping groups also post such laws on their websites and 
oftentimes send them to their members. All you need to do is 
<a href="http://www.pugetsoundbees.org/beekeeping-laws/">join a local beekeepers 
association to get access</a>.</p>

<h2>4 Benefits of Beekeeping in the City</h2>

<h3>Urban Beekeeping is for <strong>Everyone</strong></h3>

<p>Urban beekeeping has transformed everyone into a potential beekeeper. Gone are 
the days where you had to have a big farm to become a beekeeper. The urban beekeeping 
concept gives everyone an opportunity to become a beekeeper today - even if you live 
in a flat or small house in the city.</p>

<h3>It's Easier Now</h3>

<p>The small-scale nature of urban beekeeping makes it easier than countryside 
beekeeping. Urban beekeepers usually keep only a few hives, which translates to 
less work when starting off. In fact, most urban beekeepers don't do it for commercial 
purposes. They simply keep bees to reverse the trend of declining bee populations, 
to study bees closely, or to enjoy some delicious honey at the end of the nectar 
flow. But honey's usually not their primary objective, which means they deal with 
less tedious beekeeping tasks like honey harvesting.</p>

<p>One How 2 Bee follower made a good point. Make sure that the rooftop access point 
leading to your beehive is sturdy enough for you to haul beekeeping equipment 
back-and-forth from your hives. Frames, especially when they have a large amount 
of honey, can get very heavy and bringing them inside from the rooftop can get 
dangerous if your access point isn't suitable.</p>

<h3>It's Affordable</h3>

<p>Urban beekeeping is also cheaper than beekeeping in the countryside due to the 
small-scale nature of it. Even with only 300 dollars people can start beekeeping 
in the city. Countryside beekeeping is typically large-scale and, therefore, more 
capital intensive.</p>

<h3>It Makes a Difference to Bee Populations</h3>

<p>Since most people in the U.S. reside in urban areas, urban beekeeping stands 
to have the biggest impact in regards to reversing declining bee population trends. 
According to the latest statistics, approximately 80% of people living in the U.S. 
live within the boundaries of urban areas.[3] This clearly shows that urban 
beekeeping could have a greater impact than countryside beekeeping to slow the 
declining bee population trend being witnessed in the U.S. and other parts of the 
world.</p>
