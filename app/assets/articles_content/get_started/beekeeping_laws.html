<h2>Local Laws and Regulations</h2>

<p>(Need a <a href="http://how2bee.com/beekeepers-association-list/">list of beekeepers 
associations in your State</a>? Follow the link!) Before you invest time and money 
into beekeeping, it is important to first determine if there are any local regulations 
in your area that may prevent you from keeping bees or regulate how you keep bees. 
Laws and regulations on beekeeping vary between cities, districts, states, and even 
countries.</p>

<p>In the United States, for instance, there are beekeeping state and federal 
regulations. In the US, beekeeping is governed by the USDA (United States Department 
of Agriculture), the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency), and the FDA (Food 
& Drug Administration) at the federal level. Some states in the US are completely 
deregulated while others have many laws. In the regulated states, there can be 
multiple agencies administering the applicable laws.[1]</p>

<p>Therefore, you should familiarize yourself with regulatory bodies responsible 
for administering state and federal beekeeping laws in your state before you start 
keeping bees. You can do this by doing a quick search online or even going to a 
local beekeepers association. This also applies to many other nations. For example, 
many EU countries have legislation that regulates beekeeping.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that beekeeping is completely restricted in some regions. You 
may, however, be allowed to practice beekeeping with a permit. By understanding 
local rules such as regulations on property size and location, you can ensure that 
you're not breaking the law while keeping bees in your community. There may also 
be limitations on the number of hives you can have on your property.</p>

<p>Another interesting fact is that some bee strains are outlawed in certain regions. 
Certain species tend to be more aggressive than others, such as Africanized bees, 
and are outlawed to safeguard the general public from harm (such as in Florida). 
In such cases, you may only be allowed to keep certain species of bees that are 
considered to be 'gentle' or docile. Some jurisdictions may also require you to 
locate your beehive a certain number of feet away from your property line. You 
may also be required to build certain types of structures, such as tall fences, 
to minimize bee-human encounters.[2]</p>

<h2>Neighbors & Beekeepers Associations</h2>

<p>Besides local beekeeping laws and regulations, you should also be aware of the 
fact that many neighborhood housing associations restrict or limit beekeeping. You 
should check the bylaws and covenants of your neighborhood if you live in a property 
governed by a housing association.</p>

<p>Even if there are no housing association restrictions on beekeeping in your area, 
it's always a good idea to check with your neighbors to determine whether or not 
anyone near you is allergic, even deadly allergic, to bee stings. If none of your 
neighbors are allergic but just scared of bees, it is good to be considerate of 
their feelings by taking as many measures as you can to minimize their interaction. 
You can even go as far as educating them about what you learn. Even if your local 
jurisdiction doesn't have specific regulations on honey bees, a complaint from a 
neighbor could potentially fall under the general local nuisance laws.</p>

<p>To avoid this, you need to consult and educate your neighbors. It's also a good 
idea to promise them fresh honey to ease them into acceptance. You can consult with 
your local beekeeper association to find out what regulations apply to you and refer 
to neighborhood bylaws and covenants. Check out your local beekeepers association to 
make sure you are following all the local laws. They will know all of the steps to 
get you a beekeeping permit or advice on how to best follow local laws and regulations.

list of the local beekeepers associations in your State</a>, which will give you a 
huge advantage in becoming a successful beekeeper.</p>

<p>Most beekeepers associations have regularly scheduled meetings at which enthusiastic 
and experienced beekeepers are happy to share their knowledge with those who are 
starting out. A beekeepers association is a great way to get your feet wet and meet 
a network of beekeepers that could turn into long-lasting friends. Turning to your 
local zoning office is another way to learn about the specifics of any existing 
local laws. Both your local beekeepers association and zoning office can provide 
you with a print-out of the specific laws and rules governing beekeeping in your 
area.</p>
