  <p>Different seasons call for different beekeeping schedules and activities. 
  Knowing what your colony is doing in each season and what is expected of you is 
  crucial to your hive's success. Your bees in winter will have very different 
  needs than in summer. Anticipation is one of the most important keys to successful 
  beekeeping.</p>
  
  <p>The beekeeping season starts in Spring since this is the best time to start a 
  new hive. The weather is also perfect during spring. Many blossoming flowers and 
  plants experience a nectar flow that the bees can feed on. Nevertheless, you can 
  still keep bees and get the best out of them in any season. This calls for a 
  thorough understanding of how bees behave, what they need to prosper, and how to 
  make them comfortable during all seasons. Below is a detailed discussion to make 
  you a confident beekeeper regardless of the season.</p>
  
  [TOC]
  
  <h2>Bees in Summer</h2>
  
  <p>During the summer, the nectar flow reaches its peak. Your colony's population 
  is also at its peak. When this happens, bees are usually self-sufficient. Worker 
  bees tirelessly gather nectar, collect pollen and focus on making honey in the 
  summer. Your bees will also be outside the hive more often due to the high 
  temperatures inside the hive. If you see this becoming a problem, you should 
  consider improving your hive's ventilation. Below are some other tasks you should 
  consider executing during the summer.</p>
  
  <h3>Main tasks:</h3>
  
  <ol class="numbered">
    <li><em>Perform Weekly Inspections</em>: You should inspect your hive once a 
    week to make sure your colony is healthy and the queen is performing well.</li>
    
    <li><em>Add Honey Supers</em>: Since summer is the honey producing season, you 
    must keep adding honey supers when the need arises to maximize your honey 
    yield.</li>
    
    <li><em>Watch Out for Wasps and Bees from Other Colonies</em>: When honey 
    production is at its peak, you and your bees aren't the only ones that want 
    that honey. Wasps and bees from other colonies tend to invade hives during the 
    summer. You should make sure hive entrances aren't wide and you may want 
    to carve out only small holes on your hives for increased ventilation and to 
    combat intruders.</li>
    
    <li><em>Harvest Your Honey</em>: You should harvest honey when the nectar flow 
    is ending. As you harvest, it's important that you understand why bees make 
    honey to begin with – to survive through the winter. Therefore, you shouldn't 
    harvest and sell all of the honey because your bees will most likely die as a 
    result. Ideally, they should have around 60 pounds of honey for a colony of 
    60,000 bees to survive and thrive until the next nectar flow.[1]</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>Bees in Fall</h2>
  
  <p>Fall is characterized by scarce pollen and nectar sources as the days become 
  colder and shorter. When the nectar flow slows down, so does the activity in the 
  beehive. The queen stops laying eggs like she used to. The hive population begins 
  to decrease significantly, especially the drones that mate with the queen.[2] 
  The bees start using propolis in the hive to seal cracks that may be present in 
  the hive. This activity is in preparation for winter. You must step in and help 
  your bees prepare for winter by performing a few tasks below.</p>

  </div>
  
  <h3>Main tasks</h3>
  
  <ol class="numbered">
    <li><em>Inspect the Hive Regularly</em>: You must carry on with weekly inspections 
    making sure your queen is still in the hive. You can do this by looking for 
    the presence of eggs. You should be patient and attentive to spotting eggs 
    since the queen's egg-laying decreases drastically during autumn.</li>
    
    <li><em>Leave or Store Enough Honey for Your Bees</em>: You should also ensure 
    there is enough honey for your bees to last them throughout winter. 60 pounds 
    of honey is more than enough for a full colony of 60,000 bees given the fact 
    that the population will keep reducing until the next nectar flow.</li>
    
    <li><em>Treat Your Colony</em>: You may want to use Tylan or Terramycin 
    (antibiotics) to treat your colony against European and American foulbrood 
    known to affect honey bees during both autumn and winter.</li>
    
    <li><em>Provide Ventilation</em>: Contrary to what your intuition may tell you, 
    bees need proper ventilation during fall and winter despite the colder 
    temperatures. Without proper ventilation, warm air in the hive heats the cold 
    hive cover melting the ice and dripping cold water into the hive. This, in turn, 
    will either drown your bees or increase the humidity in the hive, causing them 
    to freeze. To avoid this take steps to provide proper ventilation in your 
    beehives.</li>
    
    <li><em>Cover the Hive Using Black Tar Paper</em>: This task is important if you 
    live in an area where the temperatures fall below freezing point for several 
    weeks. When covering the hive, you should ensure you don't cover the entrance 
    as well as the ventilation holes. Black tar paper absorbs more heat when the 
    sun shines in the winter if it is wrapped around your hives, helping your bees 
    to regulate the hive temperature. It can even act as a wind breaker, which is 
    particularly important if you live in an area with strong and cold wind 
    fronts.</li>
    
    <li></li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>Bees in Winter</h2>
  
  <p>Winter is the slowest season for beekeepers and bees. During the winter, the 
  queen bee is kept warm by thousands of worker bees. Bees in winter cluster in 
  the hive's brood chamber when temperatures reach 54-57°F (13-14°C). The cluster 
  usually forms in the middle of the hive body. The bees usually generate enough 
  heat to maintain a constant temperature of approximately 92°F (33°C). They are 
  able to do this by shivering their wing muscles. The bees break the cluster only 
  when the temperature is warm enough (usually above 40°F or 4°C).[3]</p>

  <h3>Main Tasks</h3>
  
  <p>There isn't much work to do during winter since you should have already 
  prepared your hive in the fall. The main task is hive inspection, as is important 
  in every season. If these tasks and the tasks in Fall are done properly, your 
  bees should live through the winter. Below are the main tasks to consider for 
  your bees in winter.</p>
  
  <ol class="numbered">
    <li><em>Check the Hive Entrance Frequently</em>: Although you will have done 
    everything in your power to help your bees survive winter, there will be some 
    casualties every now and then especially on the hive entrance. As a result, you 
    need to monitor the entrance constantly brushing off any dead bees or snow that 
    may have blocked the entrance.</li>
    
    <li><em>Monitor the Food Supply</em>: Many bees die of starvation from late 
    winter to early spring, especially if the food supply is inadequate. To avoid 
    this, monitor the food supply constantly. Bees in winter survive off the honey 
    they made in the summer. You can peek inside the hive quickly during the day 
    when it is sunny. Don't remove the frame. Just take a quick glance to see if 
    there's enough honey. Add a few pounds of it if necessary.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>Spring Beekeeping</h2>
  
  <p>Spring marks the period when established bee colonies resume their activities. 
  It's also the best time to start a new colony. The queen bee resumes her 
  egg-laying role in full force. Drones start to reappear and the hive starts to 
  buzz with activity again. Pollen and nectar also rapidly accumulate in the hive. 
  Beekeepers are busy in the springtime.[4]</p>
  
  <h3>Main Tasks</h3>
  
  <ol class="numbered">
    <li><em>Early Inspection</em>: The first thing you should do in spring is inspect 
    your colony. Check for any alarming signs. For instance, you should check if your 
    queen is missing. Your bees should be clustered up in the upper-hive body. Check 
    for buzzing or humming sounds if you can't see your bees. In most cases, your 
    bees will be fine if you performed the above seasonal tasks correctly. You 
    should be on the lookout for brood growth to confirm the queen's presence.</li>
    
    <li><em>Inspect the Food Supply</em>: You should also take time and check the 
    food supply during spring. Since the temperatures are more favorable, you can 
    do a thorough food inspection. Look everywhere for signs of honey. If you can 
    see honey, everything is great. If not, feed your bees immediately. However, 
    you don't need to feed your bees with too much honey because they will be out 
    foraging in no times.</li>
    
    <li><em>Consider Adding More Hive Bodies</em>: During spring, the hive's population 
    skyrockets. Within a few weeks, your hive may be crowded. You should plan ahead 
    and get an extra hive body to house the extra bees and to maximize honey yield.</li>
    
    <div class="center">

    </div>
    
    <li><em>Watch Out for Swarms</em>: You should be vigilant during spring as bees 
    have a tendency to invade other colonies. If you reduce your hive's entrance 
    and secure vulnerabilities the hive may exhibit, you increase the likelihood 
    that your bees will be able to successfully defend against intruders.</li>
    
    <li><em>Administer Medication</em>: Although it isn't always necessary to medicate 
    bees during spring, it's advisable to do so just to make sure your bees are free 
    of common winter diseases like fungi, bacteria, and viruses. You must, however, 
    ensure you stop the treatment 5-6 weeks before you add honey supers to your hive, 
    otherwise you risk contaminating your honey harvest.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>Conclusion & Sources</h2>
  
  <p>In a nutshell, you shouldn't have a problem taking care of your beehives when 
  you execute the main tasks for each season. As mentioned before, the best 
  beekeepers are excellent at anticipating problems. If you are able to anticipate 
  what your bees need during every season, you will be able to support them and 
  maximize your honey harvest in the process.</p>
