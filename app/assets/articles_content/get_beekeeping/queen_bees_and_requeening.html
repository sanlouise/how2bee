<p>Queen bees are the leaders of bee colonies. As a beekeeper, you should learn 
about requeening to give your bees the best chance for success. Requeening refers 
to the process of replacing a queen bee in a colony. Before focusing on how you 
do it, it's important to understand the circumstances that lead to requeening. 
In previous articles, we looked at 
<a href="http://how2bee.com/beekeeping-main-tasks" title="Assess Your Queen Bee's Performance">
how to identify if your queen is performing poorly</a>.</p>
  
<p>For instance, a poorly performing queen bee lays very few eggs or has genetics 
that make it and the colony more susceptible to parasites. Although it doesn't 
happen all the time, you'll want to know how to switch queen bees through requeening.</p>

<p>Requeening can become necessary if a colony is developing unfavorable traits, 
which typically occurs when the original queen bee is killed and replaced by one 
with inferior genes. When she mates with drones in her new colony, the offspring 
then have her undesirable characteristics, such as bad temperament. Having understood 
why requeening may be inevitable, let's now shift our focus to the process of how 
to start requeening queen bees.</p>

<h2>Requeening Steps</h2>

<h3>One: Getting Queen Bees</h3>

<p>The first step to requeening any colony is sourcing. Queen bees are usually 
bought from specialist honey bee breeders. You can get a new queen that matches 
the strain of your colony from the bee breeder who sold you your first bee package. 
Sourcing from a specialist bee breeder is highly recommended since the breeder 
knows the exact bee strain you have.</p>

<p>Your bee breeder is the best suited 
person to give you a perfect match for your colony. It is possible to produce your 
own queen bee from your colony through artificial insemination. However, very few 
beekeepers have such expertise as it requires minute precision. This is one of the 
main reasons most beekeepers get new queen bees from specialist bee breeders.</p>

<h3>Two: Hey Queen Bee, You're Demoted</h3>

<p>After sourcing your new queen bee, the next step is introducing 'queenless' 
conditions in the colony, or what is normally known as dequeening. If the old queen 
bee is still in the colony, she must be removed. If she has been killed, her cage 
needs to be removed to make way for the new queen. Dequeening is usually done midday 
when most of your bees are out foraging. This makes it much easier to spot your queen 
bee.</p>

<p>But there's another advantage to dequeening at midday. The low number of bees in 
the colony at midday since they're foraging means that the queen bee's removal causes 
little to no disturbance in the hive. After removing the old queen, the colony should 
be left alone until evening. Introducing the new queen poses serious danger to her 
since the bees are already defensive from having lost their previous queen bee. Once 
the colony calms down and accepts their previous queen bee's absence, this is when 
you should introduce your new queen to the hive.[1]</p>

<h3>Three: Presenting, Queen Bee II</h3>

<p>Although the best time to introduce the queen to her new colony is late in the 
evening, there are many other factors to consider before her royal introduction. 
For instance, the origin of your new queen bee matters. If she has been bought 
from a specialist bee breeder, she will most likely come in a package that's usually 
designed to easily introduce her to your colony. If the queen bee comes from your 
own apiary, you'll definitely have to get her a cage. Caging the new queen is 
important because new queen bees always have different odors from that of your 
colony.</p>

<p>Why are queen bees' odors important? Your bees don't like bees with a different 
odor (they correlate this with being from a different colony) and it usually results 
in harsh treatment by your bees against the new queen bee. But odors change! Your 
new queen bee will start to have the same odor as your colony the longer she stays 
in the hive. At a certain point, your colony will accept her once she stinks just 
like all your other bees!</p>

<p>The queen bee's royal cage often has a mesh pattern sealed on one end and partially 
open on the other end. The partially open end is usually blocked using candy which 
the bees eat to free their new queen. You should typically place the queen's cage 
between top-bars facing downwards or secured to the brood comb face using a stick. 
By the time the worker bees finish nibbling through the candy, the queen should 
have the same odor as the colony, reducing her chances of being rejected.</p>

<p>The process of introducing the queen is much easier when she is brought in a 
special package from a bee breeder. You just need to open the hive and place her 
in the brood chamber while making sure the exit point to the package is easily 
accessible to the colony.[2]</p>

<h3>Requeening Helpful Tips</h3>

<p>It's worth noting that the success rate of introducing queen bees is higher 
when you work with a smaller colony that has many young bees. This is due to young 
bees being generally more receptive to new queen bees. The new queen will sometimes 
be met with aggression, mostly from older bees in the colony. Therefore, you should 
introduce the new queen to groups of young bees first by creating a separate section 
in the hive. Once the new queen bee is accepted by the younger colony, the entire 
colony (including the older bees) will accept her much more easily.</p>

<p>The success rate of requeening often directly depends on whether the colony is 
undisturbed for the first week of her new reign. <strong>Don't inspect the hive 
for the first week.</strong> Any premature inspections or other disturbances in 
the hive before one week is over can result in the death of the new queen. The 
reason why is interesting.</p>

<p>According to bee breeding experts, the new queen is held accountable for any 
disturbances that take place within the first 7 days of her reign. And if a 
disturbance does occur, the punishment for new queen bees is death. Yes, that 
means your colony will kill her. So to ensure her acceptance and survival, make 
sure the hive is self-sustainable (ie. given enough food) and undisturbed for 
seven days before you do any inspections.[3]</p>

<h2>Conclusion & Sources</h2>

<p>Queen bees should be changed when you're queen is not performing like she should. 
Requeening is an important step for successful beekeepers and, by carefully 
following the steps above, your bee colony's genetics and population will quickly 
prosper.</p>
