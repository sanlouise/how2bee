<p>Figuring out how to raise honey bees is simple. Honey bees are naturally hard 
workers. For a single hive to produce 450 grams (1 pound) of honey, they must fly 
over 88,000 km (55,000 miles) and visit around 2 million flowers. Nevertheless, 
you still need to take care of them so that they can make as much honey as 
possible. If you're keen on getting the best out of your bees, you should follow 
these main tasks on how to raise honey bees.[1]</p>

<h2>Week 1: Leave Them Bee!</h2>

<p>The tasks on how to raise honey bees actually starts one full week after setting 
up your new hive. When you buy and settle your bees in their new hive, you need 
to wait one week before you open your new hive again because 
<a href="http://how2bee.com/queen-bees-and-requeening" title="Queen Bees and Requeening">
queen bees need time to be accepted by bee colonies</a>. Any disturbances during 
the first week may increases the risk that your colony will reject the new queen.</p>

<p>According to beekeeping experts, the queen is held solely responsible for any 
disturbances that take place in a new colony for the first week. She is only then 
accepted as the leader of the hive and the colony. Therefore, you shouldn't even 
open up the hive during the first week, which also gives the worker bees enough 
time to release the queen from her cage, which is an official sign that she's been 
accepted into the colony.[2]</p>

<h2>Week 2: Time to Get Started!</h2>

<p>This next week has a few interesting tasks that will teach you how to raise 
honey bees like a professional beekeeper. The best time to do your first inspection 
is during a cool sunny day with very little to no wind. You should typically do 
your first inspection anytime between 10am and 5pm when most of the bees are out 
foraging. Now let's get to the main tasks for week two and three.</p>

<h3>One: Was Your Queen Bee Accepted?</h3>

<p>The most important task on how to raise honey bees starts with discovering if 
your colony accepted their new queen bee. You should find out if the worker bees 
were able to release the queen from her cage. If you made a fairly large hole in 
the candy on the entrance of her cage, the worker bees shouldn't have a problem 
releasing her. If the queen bee is not in her cage, even better. You should confirm 
that by physically removing the cage and peeking inside to see if she's there. To 
do this task and many of the next tasks, you will need 
<a href="http://how2bee.com/top-10-beekeeping-supplies" title="Affordable Beekeeping Supplies">
beekeeping supplies like proper protective gear</a>, a smoker, and hive tools.</p>

<h3>Two: Burr Comb is Badd.</h3>

<p>In all likelihood, you're going to find burr comb. This is wild or natural comb 
built in the space around the queen bee's cage. The burr comb may even be on the 
queen's cage. Although bees take a lot of time and effort to make burr comb, it 
usually makes it hard to inspect the hive and to harvest honey in the future. So 
let's make this simple for those of you learning how to raise honey bees. Let's 
just remove it. You can do this with your hive tool. In case there are a few bees 
on the burr comb, don't be afraid to just shake the comb a few times to get them 
off.</p>

<h3>Three: Any Eggs, Your Majesty?</h3>

<p>After week one, your hive should have some eggs. The presence of eggs symbolizes 
that the queen bee has already started her work. If you're not quite sure what eggs 
look like, you can spot the eggs as whitish solids in the queen cells measuring 
approximately 25 mm in length as shown in the picture below.</p>

</div>

<p>After completing this task, you're nearly done. All that remains is to return 
the frames you removed to create space in the hive for your queen bee cage. Now 
you've finished. You don't need to do any other tasks on your first inspection. 
You can provide more syrup at this stage if the bees have consumed most of it. 
Simply make sure they have enough food, close up the hive, and leave your bees 
undisturbed for another week.</p>

<p><em>No eggs?</em> In case there are still no signs of eggs after one week, consider 
getting another queen bee. If your queen is still trapped in her cage, release her 
and wait for another week.</p>

<h2>Week 3: The Queen Bee's Performance.</h2>

<p>The main aim of inspections after week two is to access the performance of your 
queen bee. An essential part of learning how to raise honey bees is understand how 
to conduct standard inspections of your hive. It's quite simple. Lightly smoke the 
bees, open the hive, and remove the frames one-by-one for inspection, working from 
the sides to the center. You should be looking for eggs constantly because they're 
a sign that your queen bee is still in the hive performing her most important duty. 
At this stage, honey bees work from the center of your hive outwards. Itâ€™s completely 
normal if the outer frames haven't been touched yet.</p>

<h3>One: Eggs? Are You Larvae Yet?</h3>

<p>While consistently looking for eggs, you should also be looking for larvae after 
week 2 and 3. Larvae are simply fertilized eggs in a more advanced stage of development. 
Larvae resemble bright whitish glistening shrimp. If you look closely, you shouldn't 
have a problem spotting them. If you are attentive enough, you may even notice larva 
movement and spot worker bees feeding the larvae. It's very intriguing to watch!</p>

<h3>Two: Your Queen Bee's Report Card.</h3>

<p>It's crucial to assess the performance of your queen bee this week. Your main 
focus should be on the number of eggs she's laying. One of the best ways to check 
if eggs are being laid is to see if there are frames that are filled with eggs and 
larvae. If there are 1-2 frames that are completely filled (both sides) with eggs, 
your queen's performance is fantastic. If only one side of 1-2 frames is filled, 
she is performing pretty well. If there are fewer eggs than that, she's doing poorly 
and you should take measures to 
<a href="http://how2bee.com/queen-bees-and-requeening" title="Requeening Your Queen Bees">
start requeening</a>.</p>

<h3>Three: Eggs -> Larvae -> Capped Brood?</h3>

<p>By week 3, you should be seeing capped brood, which is simply the last stage of 
bee metamorphosis. Your focus should be on the center of the hive since cells with 
larvae and eggs are located on adjacent frames. It's important to note that the 
queen usually lays eggs in almost every cell and skips only a few. This results 
in a larvae and egg pattern as well as a capped brood that is packed together 
tightly stretching across the entire frame.</p>

<p>To identify capped brood easily, you should also be on the lookout for pollen 
and nectar above every one. The pollen and nectar is used to feed the brood to 
maturity. If it's there after week 3, you have a great hive. In case you spot a 
loose brood pattern, you may have a poorly performing queen and you should replace 
her immediately. A perforated or sunken brood is an indication of brood disease. 
You must find the cause and take the necessary steps to medicate them.[3]</p>

<h3>Four: The Queen Cells' Indicator.</h3>

<p>You should also check for queen cells after week three. Queen cells are created 
by worker bees when the queen isn't performing well. Queen cells are peanut-shaped 
appendages indicating that the colony is planning to replace the queen. Queen cells 
are a great indicator for those learning how to raise honey bees that your queen 
bee may need to be replaced. The cells are usually located on the upper parts of 
the frame. If you spot 3 or more queen cells, start making plans to 
<a href="http://how2bee.com/queen-bees-and-requeening" title="Requeening Your Queen Bees">
start requeening</a>.[4]</p>

<h3>Five: Tasty Sweet Sugar Syrup.</h3>

<p>Don't forget to replenish the sugar syrup supply every week so that your bees 
have enough to eat.</p>

<h2>Four to Eight Weeks: How to Raise Honey Bees</h2>

<p>After a month, your beehive should be buzzing with activity. You should constantly 
inspect your hive for evidence that your queen bee is laying eggs. You should also 
check for a steady capped brood pattern, the presence of pollen, and capped honey. 
If you have been doing your normal tasks perfectly from the first week, you should 
have a thriving hive at this point. You can now focus your energy on raising your 
honey bees with these other important tasks.</p>

<h3>One: Adding Another Hive Body?</h3>

<p>If everything is going as planned, you can add a new hive body to create room 
for more bees. Your honey bees should have drawn all the foundation on the comb 
at this point. They should have added wax and created comb cells for storing honey, 
pollen, and brood. If approximately 70% of your frames are drawn, you can add another 
deep hive body.</p>

<p>At this point, just inspect your bees as you normally would. You should lightly 
smoke your hive and then remove the outer cover as well as the hive feeder. Place 
your new hive body on top of the old hive body. Insert the frames, foundation, and 
put the top feeder on the new hive body. Replenish the sugar syrup and insert the 
outer cover. The upper hive body offers a perfect location for raising the brood 
as well as storing honey and pollen. Within no time you will have new bees in your 
hive.</p>

<h3>Two: Let Your Bees Breathe!</h3>

<p>After the fifth and sixth weeks, you should consider improving your hives' ventilation 
to make the growing colony comfortable. You can slightly move the entrance reducer 
initially placed in your hive's entrance to increase the hive entrance, which will 
improve hive ventilation. The entrance should be approximately 4 inches wide. You 
can remove the entrance reducer completely after the eighth week because the colony 
is capable of protecting itself after two months.</p>

<h3>Three: Switch Up Those Frames.</h3>

<p>Between the seventh and eighth week, you can interchange the frame order to 
encourage the bees to work harder drawing out more foundation evenly on all comb 
cells. Frames that haven't been drawn out should be placed in the center.</p>

<p>You should also interchange new frames from the new hive body with old frames 
from the old hive body. However, <em>avoid placing new frames right in the middle 
of brood nests since it makes it harder for your bees to regulate their broods' 
temperatures!</em></p>

<h3>Four: Getting Ready for the Honey!</h3>

<p>By the eighth week, your bees should have drawn out over 80% of the frames 
located in the upper body. If this is the case for you, it's time to add shallow 
honey supers with frames and foundations. At this point, your bees are prepared 
to collect honey.</p>

<h3>Five: Keep Going, You're Almost There!</h3>

<p>Since you now have more hive bodies (you can continue adding hive bodies as 
your colony increases in size), you will need to keep inspecting the entire 
colony regularly. The inspection process is the same as described above. The 
only notable difference is that you should be careful when removing honey supers 
from top to bottom. As always, you should be continuously checking your queen 
bee's performance and for signs of healthy brood.</p>
