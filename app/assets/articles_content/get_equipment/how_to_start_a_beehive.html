<p>Now that you know 
<a href="http://how2bee.com/how-to-start-beekeeping/" title="How to Start Beekeeping">
how to choose the location for your beehive in your urban, suburban or rural home</a>, 
let's shift our focus to discussing how to start a lasting beehive. There's many 
types of beehives that all have their own unique advantages and disadvantages.</p>

<p>Beehives are not a one-size-fits-all piece of equipment. Different beehives 
are ideal in different situations. You may want to just learn the basics of 
beekeeping; or perhaps you just want to pollinate the flowers in your garden; or 
perhaps you want to enjoy some of that delicious sweet honey! Your purpose for 
beekeeping is important to deciding the perfect beehive  for you. Let's have a 
quick but detailed discussion on the process of choosing the beehive that best 
suits your needs.</p>

<h2>How to Start a Beehive for You</h2>

<p>Knowing that you want a beehive is one thing. Deciding which beehive is best 
for you is something completely different. One of the best ways to choose the 
perfect hive revolves around examining your primary motives for beekeeping in the 
first place.</p>

<h3>A hive for Learning or Teaching</h3>

<p>One of the most common reasons to start beekeeping is to learn more about it. 
For instance, you may be interested in studying the behavior of bees. You may 
also be interested in observing the fascinating phenomenon that occur inside and 
outside the hive. With regard to teaching, you may want a beehive to make a 
presentation or to teach your children about bees. If that's the case, you don't 
need a sophisticated beehive. A basic hive will do just fine.</p>

<h3>A Beehive for Pollinating Your Garden or Flowers</h3>

<p>Do you love flowers? If you have plenty of flowers, vegetables, and fruits 
growing in your garden and you want to improve their pollination, we know how to 
start a perfect beehive for you. That's a perfect reason to start beekeeping. 
Your flowers, vegetables, and fruits will not only multiply faster, but they will 
also become genetically more resilient to floral diseases.[1]</p>

<p>It's worth noting that any type of beehive can help with pollination. However, 
the amount of pollination varies depending on many factors, the most notable being 
the size of the hive. For example, a larger hive offers more pollination benefits 
since larger hives house more bees. If your focus is to maximize pollination, you 
should consider getting a Warre hive.</p>

</div>

<p>In case you don't want to handle all the work that comes with managing large 
beehives, a nuc hive will also do great when placed in a corner of your garden.</p>

<h3>A Hive for Honey</h3>

<p>Maybe you just want sweet natural honey. If that's the case, a Langstroth hive 
will be the hive for you. Although larger beehives produce harvestable honey, 
the Langstroth hive is the mother of all honey-producing hives.</p>

<h2>Parts of a Hive</h2>

<p>Having understood some of the main reasons that affect the type of hive you 
should get, let's discuss the main parts of it before delving into the advantages 
and disadvantages of starting specific beehives. To do this, we'll look at the 
main parts of the most common type of hive: the Langstroth beehive.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Hive stand:</strong> A hive stand is anything that can be used to keep 
  a hive off the ground (usually 45-60 cm or 18-24 inches). A hive stand could be 
  anything from treated wood to concrete blocks. A good hive stand is one that 
  offers good ventilation as well as a level support surface for the hive. Most 
  people use pallets as hive stands.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Bottom board:</strong> This refers to the board that forms the hive's 
  bottom (as you could probably guess). The bottom board should be screened for 
  pests and ventilation. Solid or slatted wood makes the best bottom boards for hives.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Hive bodies:</strong> This refers to the framed boxes where bees live 
  as well as raise their brood. A hive is made up of multiple boxes stacked 
  together.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Supers:</strong> This refers to the boxes filled with frames where 
  bees make honey.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Foundation:</strong> This refers to the base of the hive where bees 
  'draw out' honeycombs. It's important to note that bees use patterns found on 
  foundations as guidelines for how much wax they should fill the pattern with. 
  The queen bee then lays eggs in some cells. In other cells, worker bees store 
  pollen and honey. Therefore, foundation frames hold eggs, grow the young (brood), 
  and act as pollen and honey storage.[2]</li>
  
  <li><strong>Frames:</strong> This refers to the wooden or plastic rectangular 
  structures that hold the foundation of the beehive. Frames make it possible to 
  pull out different parts of the beehive for inspection, maintenance, or 
  harvesting the honey.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Inner and telescoping outer cover:</strong> The inner cover hole 
  acts as a passageway for bees to exit the hive. The telescoping outer cover 
  secures the top of the beehive.</li>
</ol>


<h2>The Langstroth Hive</h2>

<h3>Basic information</h3>

<p>Let's go over some quick facts before describing how to start a Langstroth 
beehive. The main distinguishing aspect of a Langstroth hive revolves around the 
enclosed frames. Langstroth hives got their name from their inventor, Lorenzo 
Langstroth, who patented the Langstroth hive design back in 1860. Originally 
meant for comb honey production, Langstroth hives have become the standard style 
hives worldwide. The hives are constructed with bee space in mind, which is why 
the frames aren't glued together or filled with burr comb.[3]</p>

<div class="center">
  <img class="responsive-img article-images" src="http://streaming.yayimages.com/images/photographer/ejkrouse/7ac3f8bd1b4c7e354c44efb6027f7f75/honey-bees.jpg">
</div>

<p>Typical Langstroth hives feature tops and bottoms placed on top of one other. 
The hives also have internal frames which allows for interchangeable parts. This 
makes it extremely easy to inspect the hive without harming the bees. The hive 
also has a rectangular shape while the frames are usually hung in parallel. 
Typical Langstroth hives can be made using a variety of materials.</p>

<p>The size of Langstroth hives is mostly dependent on potential food sources and 
air temperatures during winter. Larger Langstroth hives are more ideal in areas 
with colder winters since they offer more space for food storage. Langstroth 
frames are usually thin rectangular structures made of plastic or wood. A typical 
Langstroth hive can hold 10 frames side-by-side leaving enough space in-between 
frames and the hive's body.[4]</p>

<h3>Main Advantages</h3>

<p><strong>Universality:</strong> This is by far one of the main advantages of 
constructing a Langstroth hive over any other type of hive. Since they are used 
internationally, you can find replacement parts and add-ons easily no matter 
your location, even for some of the most recent Langstroth hive versions. You 
can visit any beekeeping store around your area or search the web to identify a 
good Langstroth hive supplier near you.</p>

<p><strong>Easy to Construct:</strong> The straightforward design of Langstroth 
hives makes them easy to build. The most challenging part of constructing the 
hive is fabricating the joints. If you have some basic woodworking knowledge or 
experience, this shouldn't be a problem. Also, there are many 
<a href="http://how2bee.com/beekeeping-books" title="Top 10 Beekeeping Books">
great beekeeping books</a> that can make the process easier.</p>

<p><strong>Affordable:</strong> It costs approximately $160 or less to build a 
Langstroth hive. The cost can be even lower if you use scrap wood. The cost 
covers everything including the hardware, fasteners, lumber, and other components. 
When you compare the cost of building other hives (typically over $200 for a 
modern beehive), the Langstroth is undoubtedly one of the most affordable hives 
to construct at home.[5]</p>

<h3>Main Disadvantage</h3>

<p><strong>Paint Toxins:</strong> Since most Langstroth hives are painted for 
durability and aesthetic purposes, the hives pose some risk to the bees and the 
environment since paint is known to contain chemicals that could not only harm 
the bees but also significantly decrease the quality of honey they produce.</p>

<h2>The Top-Bar Hive</h2>

<h3>Basic information</h3>

<p>You might be wondering how to start a beehive if you're interested in natural 
beekeeping. Some beekeepers believe the top-bar hive is the more natural form of 
beekeeping.[6] Top-bar hives are characterized by their bars from which honey 
bees attach and hang wax combs (an array of six-sided hexagonal cells). Top-bar 
hives are usually made of wood. The top-bars measure 32-35 mm wide depending on 
factors such as the type of bees to be housed and local climate conditions. The 
depth and length of the bar is usually between 43 and 50 cm (17 and 20 inches). 
The hive body usually resembles a long box featuring many top-bars situated 
side-by-side.</p>

<div class="center">
  <img class="responsive-img article-images" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Top_bar_hive.JPG/640px-Top_bar_hive.JPG">
</div>

<p>Unlike Langstroth hives, top-bar hives don't feature an entrance as part of 
the ventilation system. This makes top-bar hives more flexible with regard to 
configuration and placement. A single entrance, featuring a landing platform, 
helps to restrict pollen placement as combs with pollen tend to be located near 
the entrance. A single entrance also helps to make the hive more secure as bees 
can better defend their home against bee and pest invasions.</p>

<p>It's also important to protect the entrance using a roof extension or some form 
of canopy to reduce the amount of dew accumulating on the hive's landing platform. 
Large water droplets can trap bees leaving the hive early in the morning when the 
water hasn't evaporated yet and a canopy over the landing platform will assist in 
preventing this. The typical design of top-bar hives also offers protection 
against hive beetles and honey badgers, among other pests. Features like small 
entrances at the bottom provide adequate protection while possessing open-screened 
bottoms for ventilation. Top-bar hives are designed to offer better pest control 
and ventilation.[7]</p>

<h3>Main Advantages</h3>

<p><strong>Simple and Affordable to Build:</strong> The simplicity of top-bar hives 
allows the use of salvage materials like half-drums and boxes to construct the 
hives. Almost any type of container can be turned into a top-bar hive provided 
that the bars are perfectly placed across the top, there's a single defensible 
entrance, and a weather-tight cover is used. This allows you to forget about many 
of the hurdles that come with building your own hive. The top-bar hive design 
can be easily improvised, which offers many opportunities for addons while also 
proving to be cost effective. It could potentially cost you nothing if you 
construct your top-bar hive from 100% improvised materials.</p>

<p><strong>Better Hive Management:</strong> Sliding follower boards that enclose 
the colony within the top-bar beehive body means you can inspect your hive very 
quickly and effortlessly. Hive inspection is made simple with this hive by just 
lifting up individual bars. Top-bar hive inspections don't disturb bees 
particularly. Some modern top-bar hives are built with a viewing glass on the 
side of the beehive allowing you to observe your bees without disturbing them.</p>

<h3>Main Disadvantages</h3>

<p><strong>Honey with High Pollen Content:</strong> Since one can harvest honey 
from a top-bar hive simply by cutting the honey comb, then crushing it, and 
straining the honey, the resulting honey often has a high pollen content, 
potentially not ideal for people with allergies.</p>

<p><strong>Lower Quality Honey:</strong> The design of the top-bar hive results 
in irregular comb sizes which easily break and do not typically fit in most 
commercially available honey extractors (most honey extractors are designed for 
Langstroth hive frames). This means that the resulting honey may not be of the 
best quality since it's difficult to purify it commercially.</p>

<h2>Water Source</h2>

<p>Bees cannot live without water. If you're wondering how to start a beehive, 
you should also focus on creating a water source nearby your hive. While this 
has been primarily a discussion on how to start a beehive, you may want to think 
of making a water source along with the beehive. Bees need water to do two tasks 
– to make honey and to cool the hive. If the temperature of a hive does not need 
regulating due to cool weather conditions, most bees will pick up enough water 
as they forage since nectar is composed primarily of water. However, in times 
when the colony does need to regulate the hive's temperature, this could necessitate 
the foraging of water by worker bees. And bees are experts at finding water. 
Consequently, if you forget to provide a water source, they may decide to get 
their water from your neighbors and, possibly, even your neighbor's pool.[8]</p>

<div class="center">
  <img class="responsive-img article-images" src="http://streaming.yayimages.com/images/photographer/pinkblue/35022dd1245928f023e26a98d828c589/beautiful-blossom-white-lotus-with-a-bee-on-yellow-pollen.jpg">
</div>

<p>An ideal water source for bees is one that is located nearby. It should 
preferably offer a landing pad for the bees so that it reduces the chance of 
them falling in and drowning. You can do this by planting some floating water 
plants in your water source to act as a landing platform. Such plants offer a 
secure foothold for bees even when water levels shift. Some of the best plants 
for bee water sources include salvinia, azolla and frogbit. Be careful though, 
as constructing a standing water source attracts other insects, such as mosquitoes. 
If there are fish in your pond, they will gladly eat those mosquitoes for you. 
Based on these guidelines, an artificial pond is a perfect water source for 
bees as they often recognize it as physically appealing and sustaining.</p>

<p>You can create an artificial water source for your bees using any container 
like a bucket, a barrel, a tub, among others. The water source shouldn't be more 
than two feet deep. Wider containers are better because they offer more surface 
area for the bees to gather water from. The pond should be placed in an open area 
where there is partial shade or direct sunlight since bees love warm water when 
it's cold and cold water when it's hot. It's also important to locate the water 
away from the bee's flight path so that their feces don't contaminate their water 
source.</p>

<p>With regard to maintenance, you don't need any chemicals, fertilizers, or even 
fish food to balance the pond. Like rivers and lakes, ponds accumulate nutrients 
naturally through eutrophication.[9] Instead, you should concentrate on ensuring 
the pond is covered with plants since this is the best way of preventing algae 
growth and to maintain nutrient-rich water.</p>
