<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>This guide is undoubtedly one of the most highly rated beekeeping guides 
available today based on customer reviews. The book is written by famous beekeeping 
expert Michael Bush who focuses on keeping bees in a natural as well as practical 
system where they don't require treatments for bee diseases and pests, just 
minimal intervention. As the name suggests, the guide is about simple, practical, 
and natural beekeeping aimed at reducing the work of the beekeeper. The beekeeping 
book stands out since it's not your typical mainstream guide. In fact, most 
concepts are contrary to conventional beekeeping concepts. However, the concepts 
presented have been streamlined through years of experimentation, adjustments, 
and an emphasis on simplification. The Practical Beekeeper is <em>ideal for both 
new and experienced beekeepers</em> since it is divided into 3 volumes. This 
edition contains all three volumes: beginning, intermediate, and advanced.</p>

<h3>The Author</h3>

<p>The author, the true beekeeping expert Michael Bush, is a vocal advocate of 
treatment-free beekeeping practices. Michael Bush has been a beekeeper since the 
mid 1970's when he started with just two hives. By 2008, Michael had over 200 
beehives. He is an active member of many beekeeping forums having contributed to 
over 50,000 posts. Check out his 
<a href="http://bushfarms.com/bees.htm" title="Bush Farms">own website here</a>.</p>

<p>The Practical Beekeeper is packed with rich content and detail, but even so it
is written in a simple and organized structure. Michael's beekeeping experience 
and his massive amount of interactions with millions of people in his 50,000+ 
beekeeping posts gave him priceless insights on reaching the typical beekeeper 
using the simplest language possible. Beekeeping guides can't get simpler than 
The Practical Beekeeper without compromising on detail.</p>

<h3>What Customers Think</h3>

<p>Most customer reviews about this book are positive. Most people love the 
simplicity of the guide and the breadth of its content. They also love the price 
(only $45.83) considering the guide contains over 600 pages of rich beekeeping 
content. The beekeeping book is definitely worth the money according to most 
online customer reviews. Many reviews also praise the book for offering very 
practical insights on natural and stress-free beekeeping. They also attest to 
the fact that the book was written by a person with decades of beekeeping knowledge. 
Although there are a few negative reviews surrounding the length of the guide 
(some people think it's too long) and the picture quality (there are many 
black-and-white pictures), the guide is definitely the best in the market for 
new and seasoned beekeepers looking for practical and natural beekeeping 
insights.</p>
