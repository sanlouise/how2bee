<p>Beekeeping is a rewarding hobby or even career, but every serious beekeeper 
knows the importance of being prepared. So, once you decide on the type of 
beehive you want, you can start getting your beekeeping equipment and beekeeping 
supplies. There are 10 pieces that the majority of beekeepers use before, during, 
and after interacting with their honey bees. Below is a discussion of each of 
these beekeeping supplies so that you can feel confident when raising your honey 
bees.</p>

<h2>Top 3 Beekeeping Equipment Clothing</h2>

<h3>The Bee Suit</h3>

<p>A bee suit is undoubtedly the most important piece of beekeeping equipment to 
get when you are starting out. Bee stings are painful and potentially dangerous 
(especially if you are allergic), which is why you need to invest in a high-quality 
bee suit, especially if you are a beginner beekeeper.</p>

<p>For those of you that are focused on getting some delicious natural honey with 
the least amount of stings, let's get into the specifics of finding the 
best bee suit for you. Since there are many bee suits on the market today, it is 
easy to get confused about what makes a good one. To avoid this, let's talk about 
what makes the best bee suit in today's market.</p>

<p><em><strong>How Affordable is a Bee Suit?</strong></em></p> 

<p>One of the most important factors to consider when buying a bee suit is whether 
or not you are getting the quality you're paying for. Although the best bee suits 
cost between $100 and $150, it is possible to get a good bee suit for around $60.</p>

<p>That said, you should be more careful when buying bee suits that are priced low 
because they tend to lack important features. Cheap bee suits will also be low 
quality (unless you get lucky!) Ideally, you could even buy half a bee suit to 
get high-quality material at a more affordable price.</p>

<p><em><strong>Making Sure Your Bee Suit is a Perfect Fit</strong></em></p> 

<p>Regardless of the price, you need a bee suit that fits you perfectly. There are 
all types of bee suit sizes that match all different body shapes from small and 
petite bee suits to tall, XL, and XXL. You really shouldn't worry too much about 
your body type because, in all likelihood, there's a bee suit out there that will 
perfectly fit you.</p>

<p>Size is a very important aspect to consider because your bee suit should be 
comfortable. The best bee suits are those that don't inhibit your movement as you 
will be bending over frequently to inspect your beehives. Another tip when choosing 
a bee suit is to make sure that the waist is elastic for a more comfortable and 
maneuverable fit.</p>

<p><em><strong>Bee Suit Material and Color</strong></em></p> 

<p>A bee suit can be made out of all types of material. The most common material 
is either 100% nylon or a mix of cotton and polyester. The best bee suit will be 
made of heavy-duty cotton and polyesters because they tend to be more durable and 
comfortable. Nylon bee suits also have their own advantages as they tend to be more 
affordable. They are also water resistant, which is extremely useful if you live in 
an area where it rains a lot.</p>

<p>At the same time, this type of bee suit can get really hot in summer. Now that 
you know a bit about the materials in a bee suit, let's move to colors. This is 
essential! Bees feel threatened by dark colors because they often think it's a 
<a href="http://how2bee.com/bee-diseases-and-bee-predators/" title="Prevent Against Bee Predators">
bee predator, such as dark-colored flying insects</a>.[1] This means you'll 
definitely want a white or light-colored bee suit so that your bees feel happy 
when you inspect their hive.</p>

<p><em><strong>Important Bee Suit Accessories</strong></em></p> 

<p>Other important bee suit accessories to look out for include pockets, zippers, 
and thumb holds. The best bee suits have enough pockets (typically two chest 
pockets and two pants pockets) that can fit a hive tool, gloves, medication 
containers, among any other type of beekeeping supplies.</p>

[IMG]

<p>The best bee suit should also have heavy-duty zippers for easy removal and 
reliable sealing. Elastic wrist thumb holds are also important for making sure 
the bee suit sleeves don't roll over during hive inspections, which could expose 
you to bee stings.</p>

<p><em><strong>Quick Tip for a Bee Suit</strong></em></p> 

<p>You really don't have to buy a full bee suit, especially if you are an experienced 
beekeeper. Many people choose to buy a simple light-colored jacket with a bee veil 
instead of buying a full bee suit. In fact, you could save almost 20-30% by buying 
half a bee suit.</p>

<p>That said, you do need a good pair of jeans and shoes (ie. trainers or boots in 
good condition). You'll also want to take steps against bees entering your pockets 
and under your clothing through the feet if you don't tuck in your pants tightly.</p>

<h3>Is it a Wedding? Nope, it's just a Bee Veil!</h3>

<p>After you get your bee suit, it's time to choose a bee veil. We aren't trying 
to suggest a marriage between you and your bees, but the bee veil is very important 
to protect your eyes, mouth, nose, and ears when beekeeping.</p>

<p>Although it's possible to buy a bee suit without a veil to cut costs or to increase 
your ability to move, new beekeepers should definitely buy a full bee suit along 
with a bee veil. Although helmets can substitute veils, they don't offer the kind 
of protection and comfort a bee veil can give you.</p>

<p>So let's go over the types of bee veils as they come in many shapes, sizes, zipper 
types, and so much more. The bee veil you settle for should make it easy for you to 
see. In addition, it should also have a good self-supporting mechanism while still 
being a comfortable size that matches your personal preferences.</p>

<p>The bee veil should absolutely offer ventilation. Although most bee suits come 
with bee veils, there are many options available to you in case you want to get a 
customized or a separate veil from the one that comes with your bee suit.</p>

<h3>The Best Beekeeping Gloves</h3>

<p>After you get your bee suit, you're probably wondering about the best beekeeping 
gloves that are out there. Well, the answer is not very simple. The entire beekeeping 
community is divided on the use of beekeeping gloves. In fact, some people don't 
like wearing beekeeping gloves at all because they want to “feel” the bees without 
squashing them on accident. At the same time, other people like to protect themselves 
from painful stings with thick beekeeping gloves.</p>

<p>So why are some folks able to withstand bee stings without using beekeeping gloves? 
This answer <em>is</em> simple. Many beekeepers become resistant to bee venom after 
being stung repeatedly. Nonetheless, the resistance doesn't keep the hands from 
swelling if they aren't covered. The resistance also doesn't take away the pain, 
though they may become more accustomed to it.[2] For this reason, it's highly 
recommendable for most people to wear beekeeping gloves when handling their honey 
bees.</p>

<p><em><strong>How Affordable are Beekeeping Gloves?</strong></em></p> 

<p>Good beekeeping gloves range from $10 to 23. The price depends on many factors, 
the most notable being the material of the beekeeping gloves. Let's now move to a 
brief discussion of the main types of beekeeper gloves.</p>

<p><em><strong>Beekeeping Glove Material and Color</strong></em></p> 

<p>The best types of beekeeping gloves are those that are made of thick synthetic 
leather. Gloves made of goatskin and leather could also be effective, but we at 
How 2 Bee recognize the intense suffering most goats and other animals go through 
before being skinned, so we do not recommend them. In regards to color, you should 
go for white or light-colored beekeeping gloves since bees feel threatened by dark 
objects, as mentioned before.</p>

<p><em><strong>Tips when Buying Beekeeping Gloves</strong></em></p> 

<p>If you choose to wear beekeeping gloves, they should cover your wrists and 
fold over the arms of your jacket. You should also keep in mind how thick your 
beekeeping gloves are. Thicker beekeeping gloves make it more difficult to pick 
up individual bees and perform delicate beekeeping operations. Although some 
beekeepers choose to use surgical or dish-washing gloves because they are thinner, 
cheaper, and easier to find, they don't grant the same protection as thick synthetic 
leather gloves, which are specially designed to perform beekeeping tasks.</p>

<h3>Beekeeping Shoes</h3>

<p>You can start your beekeeping experience on a perfect note with good trainers. 
You don't have to spend any money buying specialized beekeeping footwear. A good 
pair of boots will work perfectly. However, you need to secure your bee suit on 
your footwear using rubber bands, leg straps, or foot sleeves to make sure that 
your bees don't crawl into your shoes or, even worse, up your pants.</p>

<h2>Beekeeping Supplies and Tools</h2>

<p>To get started as a beekeeper, you need a variety of beekeeping supplies and 
tools. The amount of beekeeping supplies will vary depending on many factors 
ranging from the number of colonies you have to your overall purpose of keeping 
honey bees. The basic beekeeping supplies you'll need include: the hive components, 
the smoker, the hive tool, and honey extraction equipment.</p>

<h3>Hive Components</h3>

<p>Although there are many types of hives today, most beekeepers in the US use 
the Langstroth or the modern 10-frame hive. A typical hive will consist of a hive 
stand, bottom board (with entrance cleat/reducer, hive bodies (a series of boxes) 
with suspended frames with the comb or foundation and, lastly, the inner and outer 
covers.</p>

<p>You may have to construct or buy these components. Check out the specific 
<a href="http://how2bee.com/how-to-start-a-beehive" title="How to Start a Beehive">
hive components to build your hive here</a>.</p>

<h3>The Bee Smoker: Essential Beekeeping Supplies!</h3>

<p>A bee smoker is another crucial part of the beekeeping supplies you'll need to 
become a confident beekeeper. Bee smokers are devices that are designed to produce 
smoke by burning various fuels. The smoke produced is then used to calm bees down 
to allow you to inspect your hive, harvest your honey, among other beekeeping 
activities.</p>

<p>Bee smokers have been used for centuries to calm honey bees. The scientific 
explanation behind this suggests that smoke masks alarm pheromones, which are 
released by guard bees to alert other bees of imminent danger.</p>

<p>If you're interested in how bee smokers have changed over the last 100 years, 
check out this 
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Historical.Honeybee.Articles/videos/781740698547095/?fref=nf" title="Using Pipes as Bee Smokers in 1925">
awesome video of Dutch beekeepers around the year 1925</a>. (It may take a second 
to load, but it's worth the wait!)</p>

<p>A typical bee smoker is a metal fire pot that measures around 4 by 7 inches and 
costs around $30. The best bee smokers have a number of features. For instance, a 
good bee smoker must have a heat shield (around the firebox) to protect you from 
burns as you work in the hive. A high-quality bee smoker should also have a hook 
that allows you to hang the bee smoker almost anywhere near or on an open hive body 
so you can be hands-free while inspecting the hive.</p>

<p>Features aside, a good bee smoker must also be able to produce enough thick 
smoke to calm your bees. For this to occur, the bee smoker must have efficient 
bellows and vents. The smoker also needs to be resupplied with suitable bee smoker 
fuel. Some of the best bee smoker fuels include wood shavings, cardboard, pine 
needles, cotton rags, dry leaves, sumac bobs, corn cobs, and burlap.</p>

<p>The fuel also needs to be placed appropriately inside the bee smoker to produce 
plenty of thick smoke. Ideally, most of the bee smoker fuel must be placed above 
the non-burned materials and grate within the smoker. Don't worry, we'll go over 
the specifics of bee smoker fuel later in this article.</p>

[IMG]

<h3>The Hive Tool: A Beekeeper's Best Friend</h3>

<p>A hive tool is perhaps the <em>most</em> important part of the beekeeping supplies 
you'll need. A hive tool is simply a metal bar scraper. The hive tool is considered 
to be among the most crucial pieces of beekeeping equipment because of its multiple 
applications. For instance, a hive tool can be used to take apart frames in a honey 
super or a brood chamber. A hive tool can also be used to separate hive bodies as 
well as to scrape away bee propolis and beeswax.</p>

<p>The best hive tool makes hive inspections and honey harvesting very easy, quicker, 
and smooth. They are also made with multipurpose applications in mind, as a few of 
them will have additional nail pullers and integrated top-bar scrapers. The price 
of a typical metal hive tool ranges from $5 to 10.</p>

<p>Although putty knives and screwdrivers are used as substitutes for the hive 
tool, this is highly discouraged because these tools can potentially damage the 
frames and the hive body. Also, such substitutes do a very poor job in comparison 
to the hive tool, so they should never be used by anyone who is serious about 
beekeeping.</p>

<h2>Honey Extraction Beekeeping Supplies</h2>

<h3>The Honey Extractor</h3>

<p>One of the most important honey harvesting beekeeping equipment is the honey 
extractor. This can be attributed to the fact that the honey extractor is responsible 
for handling one of the most difficult beekeeping tasks: honey harvesting. Honey 
extractors are undoubtedly the most expensive beekeeping supplies considering a 
basic honey extractor costs more than $200. You can 
<a href="http://how2bee.com/beekeepers-associations-laws" title="Local Beekeepers Associations">
borrow a honey extractor from local beekeepers associations</a> if you aren't able 
to buy one on your own immediately.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can make your own honey extractor with a bucket and a filter. 
That said, you do need to invest in a good bucket composed of food-grade plastic 
to avoid honey contamination.</p>

[IMG]

<p>You shouldn't expect to harvest all of your honey if you decide to make a honey 
extractor yourself. Homemade honey extractors always result in a lot of wastage 
since they don't come with useful tools, such as a plastic uncapping scratcher, 
uncapping knives, uncapping tanks, a filter, among other beekeeping supplies for 
honey extraction. Therefore, it's wise to make plans to invest in a proper honey 
extractor if you want to maximize the quantity and quality of your honey.</p>

<h3>Honey Containers</h3>

<p>You will need honey containers to both carry and store your honey. The number 
of honey containers you need depends on the amount of honey your bees manage to 
produce. You can use plastic honey containers or glass jars for honey storage. If 
you want to sell your honey, you need presentable honey containers. Glass jars are 
the best types of honey containers for storing or packaging honey for sale.</p>

<p>You can buy standard-sized honey jars in bulk to get a discount. A 24-pack of 
glass honey jars (8 oz or 226.79 g each) costs around $14. Similarly, glass honey 
jars that are double that size only cost a bit more - around $17. Depending on 
your preferences and market, you shouldn't have a problem finding beautiful honey 
containers.</p>

<p>You can also use plastic honey containers to store and package your honey for 
home use as well as for commercial purposes. Plastic squeeze bottles are the best 
because they make honey application easier. If you have friends or family who 
wouldn't mind buying honey in plastic honey containers, plastic squeeze bottles 
are the best option for you.</p>

<p>You can get a 24 pack (8 oz or 226.79 g each) squeeze plastic bottles with flip 
tops for less than $10. Similarly, plastic squeeze bottles that are double the 
size only cost a bit more, around $13. Buying in bulk is always advisable because 
you stand to get even better prices.</p>

<h2>Useful Tips When Buying Beekeeping Supplies</h2>

<h3>Be Careful of Unassembled Beekeeping Supplies!</h3>

<p>Beekeeping equipment is usually unassembled when purchased. However, it's 
possible to purchase assembled equipment, though it typically comes at a higher 
price and shipping fee. You shouldn't worry too much about buying unassembled 
beekeeping supplies because the beekeeping equipment is usually accompanied by 
assembly directions that are easy-to-follow.</p>

<p>Even so, beginner beekeepers are always encouraged to seek assistance from 
experienced beekeepers when assembling your beekeeping supplies for the first 
time.</p>

<h3>When should you purchase beekeeping supplies?</h3>

<p>Beginner beekeepers are also advised to buy their beekeeping supplies before 
the beekeeping season starts so that they have enough time to assemble and paint 
their hives.</p>

[IMG]

<h3>To Buy or To Build, That's The Question.</h3>

<p>Although most new beekeepers prefer making their own beekeeping supplies (ie. 
beehive and honey extractor) to save money, it takes less time and effort to just 
buy it. You will also save yourself the headache of making standardized beehive 
equipment since you have to use a very detailed beehive construction plan or even 
buy commercial pieces to assemble it. Making beehive equipment like bottom boards, 
covers, hive bodies and frames can be very difficult unless you're a carpenter or 
good at woodworking.</p>

<p>The success rate of building a beehive from scratch is usually very low, though 
it's dependent on a beekeeper's woodworking skills, proper construction equipment, 
as well as the availability and cost of hive materials. If you are enthusiastic to 
start beekeeping, it's better to spend that excitement to better prepare and 
<a href="http://how2bee.com/how-to-raise-honey-bees/" title="The Tasks to Raise Honey Bees">
learn about how to raise honey bees</a> once they arrive.</p>

<h3>Where do I get beekeeping supplies?</h3>

<p>Sourcing beekeeping supplies at first can be a daunting task, but there are 
many beekeepers that know of the places to get the best beekeeping equipment at 
the most affordable price. That's why it's a strong choice to ask your local 
beekeepers associations or to sign up for a regional beekeeping newsletter.</p>

[IMG]

<h2>Beekeeping Supplies to Buy Regularly</h2>

<p>Once you make the initial investment of buying a beehive and your beekeeping 
supplies, you could spend decades without having to incur any major costs or 
replace anything. If you secure your beehive from harsh weather, such as rain 
and snow (using outer/inner covers), while also protecting your hive against bee 
predators like bears, mice, and beetles, which are capable of damaging the hive, 
your hive could last for more than 30 years.</p>

<p>However, there are some minor costs to maintaining the hive, so let's go over 
them. These costs (popularly known as recurring costs) are what we are interested 
in discussing below. Recurring costs for beehives are usually small if you invest 
in a good hive and beekeeping supplies from the start. For instance, buying a good 
hive in the beginning will save you from repair costs.</p>

<p>Using the right tools (a hive tool instead of a knife, for instance) will 
prevent unnecessary damage on the hive body, which will save you from unexpected 
hive damage costs in the future. You shouldn't expect to spend much after your 
initial costs if you start on the right note.</p>

<p>Some of the most common beekeeping supplies you'll want to buy continuously 
include buying queen bees, bee medication, and bee food (syrup and enhancers). 
If you intend on getting another hive body, you may incur additional costs buying 
package bees for your new hive.</p>

<p>However, you can choose more affordable options, such as adding a new hive 
body and raising a new colony from the old one. The recurring costs of beekeeping 
are typically not too expensive, but it is still important to be aware of them 
before you begin.</p>

<h3>Bee Food Substitute: Sugar Syrup</h3>

<p>Honey bees are natural foragers so you don't have to worry about feeding them 
once they're settled in the hive. Before then, you should feed them with their 
staple food, which is sugar syrup made from white granulated sugar water. In all 
likelihood, this won't cost more than $5 to 10 per month. Brown sugar and raw 
sugar are not good for your bees because they have impurities, which can hurt their 
immune systems.[3]</p>

[IMG]

<p>This is precisely why you need to use granulated sugar (since no sugar is better 
for bees than pure sucrose). You should mix granulated sugar with hot water (4.5 
pounds of granulated sugar for every liter of water). The water should be heated 
to a boil and then removed from the heat before the sugar is added. Then, just mix 
and stir to form yummy sugar syrup for your bees.</p>

<p>Honey bees may need thicker or thinner syrup depending on the season. The above 
ratio (2:1) is used to make thick syrup. Thick syrup is ideal when bees are new 
in a hive and when there's very few plants and flowers to forage (ie. during the 
winter). Thin syrup is ideal during spring and summer when pollen and nectar are 
abundant. Thin syrup is made by mixing sugar and hot water in a ratio of 1:1.</p>

<p>A typical colony consumes around 10 pounds of sugar syrup every week when there 
is little to no food. Considering a kilogram of granulated sugar costs about $1.23, 
expect to spend approximately $5.50 per week when there is a shortage of nectar. 
However, bees can also feed on honey during the winter when there is a nectar and 
pollen shortage. Therefore, the recurring cost of beekeeping supplies like sugar 
syrup isn't too significant. The typical cost for sugar syrup per month varies from 
$5 to $10 per month during a good year (where there is no nectar and pollen 
shortage).</p>

<h3>Bee Feed Enhancers</h3>

<p>Apart from feeding your bees with sugar syrup, bee feed enhancers are an 
important part of the beekeeping supplies you'll need to get regularly. Bee feed 
enhancers provide bees with essential nutrients that aren't available in sugar 
syrup. Feed enhancers also protect bees from common bee diseases such as varroa, 
chalkbrood, and nosema, among many others.</p>

<p>One of the best bee feed enhancers is VitaFeed Gold. You need to treat your 
bees once a year with a bee feed enhancer like VitaFeed Gold. A 250ml bottle of 
VitaFeed Gold, which costs $26.30, is capable of treating one colony 5 times over 
5 years. Therefore, you're actually only paying $5.26 per year for the bee food 
enhancer. Feed enhancers like VitaFeed Gold are administered together with sugar 
syrup in five doses over 10 days.</p>

<h3>New Queen Bees</h3>

<p>Every colony needs a new queen bee each year since they'll usually become 
unproductive after a year. That means it's going to be a recurring beekeeping 
supplies cost for you on an annual basis. To keep the colony vibrant and growing, 
you need a new queen bee to take over from the old one after a year.</p>

<p>You may require a new queen bee before a year is over if the original queen 
bee isn't performing well (ie. she's laying few eggs) or if she dies. The average 
cost of a queen bee is $30, so you should expect to spend only $30 every year for 
queen bees if everything goes well.</p>

[IMG]

<h3>The Smoker Fuel</h3>

<p>Smoker fuel is one of the most common beekeeping supplies you'll need. The 
frequency at which you buy smoker fuel depends on the type of fuel you are using 
as well as the number of hive inspections and honey harvesting sessions you carry 
out.</p>

<p>When starting out as a beekeeper, you need to check your hive at most once a 
week to allow <a title="Requeening" href="http://how2bee.com/queen-bees-and-requeening/">
your colony enough time to accept the queen bee</a>. Carrying out too many inspections 
in the early stages agitates the colony, which may give rise to other problems. 
The colony could even reject and kill the queen bee, or the colony can become 
aggressive. However, when you do start inspecting your hive, the bee smoker fuel 
is one of the most important beekeeping supplies you'll need to get frequently.</p>

<p>If you are using wood shavings, dry leaves, corn cobs, among other free bee smoker 
fuels, you won't incur any fuel costs. However, it is very advisable to use fuel 
that has been specifically made for bee smokers. This type of fuel is commonly 
referred to as bee smoker fuel. The fuel is made up of small ground pieces of fibers 
that produces a thick cloud of smoke while not being too intense for your bees' 
health.</p>

<p>Bee smoker fuel is better than wood shavings, cotton rags, and dry leaves, among 
other common fuels used with smokers because it is easy to light, it burns smoothly, 
and it produces the thickest smoke. Smoker fuel costs around $1.95 per pound and 
is capable of lasting for 10-12 inspections (a full season or 3 months). Bee smoker 
fuel will also last shorter or longer depending on the time you spend in the hive 
on every visit.</p>

<h2>Conclusion & Sources</h2>

<p>The above information summarizes the recurring beekeeping supplies for a typical 
beekeeper. Assuming you don't add hives, supers, frames, queens, a honey extractor, 
among any other hive tools, the overall recurring expenditures for beekeepers is 
about $100-130. Beekeeping supplies is very affordable and with the amount of 
benefits you get from raising honey bees, it's well worth the investment!</p>
